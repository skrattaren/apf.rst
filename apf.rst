Preface to v9.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first 'real' release of the Annotated Pratchett File since the
v7a.0 release of 16 June 1996.

Back then, I apologised for the eighteen months that had passed between
v7.0 and v7a.0, and I promised I would do better next time. Um, yes.

Apologising again, but now for the eight *years* that have passed between
v7a.0 and this v9.0, seems a bit pointless. Let me instead just thank all
you APF readers for your patience, your submissions, your corrections, and
your offers to help. In all those eight years the flow of supportive words
and emails and Usenet messages never once dried up, and I doubt if I could
ever express adequately enough how motivating and helpful that has been.

Having learned my lesson, I will make no promises or predictions this time
with respect to future releases of the APF, but my honest intention is for
v9.0 to signal the start of a period of steady APF development on all
fronts: annotation content, World Wide Web version, typeset version –
everything. In a sense I still consider v9.0 an 'intermediate' version, and
I have Plans for major improvements all over. We will just have to see how
(and when!) it all plays out; for now I hope that v9.0 will be a welcome
milestone, of sufficient quality to make sure everybody is once again
willing to come along on the next leg of the trip.

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are now reading the 9th edition of the Annotated Pratchett File, or APF
for short. For information about what is new or changed in v9.0 with
respect to previous editions I refer you to the new "`Version History and
Timeline`_" section in the "`Editorial Comments`_" chapter.

Ever since its creation in 1992, one of the most popular pastimes on the
Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett has been discussing the many jokes,
parodies, allusions and references with which Terry Pratchett seasons his
work. Since, as Terry once put it, "alt.fan.pratchett as an entity has the
attention span of a butterfly on cocaine", it quickly became clear that it
would be a good idea to distil some of these discussions into something
with a little more persistence and staying power than individual Usenet
articles (remember that this all took place long before something like
Google Groups – or indeed even the World Wide Web itself – existed!). And
so the "`The Annotated Pratchett File`_" was born, and (because I was brave or
foolish enough to volunteer) I became its editor.

Over the years the APF has grown in popularity and size. It now contains
nearly two thousand annotations, and is available in a number of different
formats. Yet it is still (and if I can help it will always be) called a
'file', reflecting its origin as a short text file that I regularly posted
to alt.fan.pratchett.

The structure of the APF is straightforward, with the annotations divided
into two large chapters: the "`Discworld Annotations`_", and all the "`Other
Annotations`_". Within each group, the books are listed in the order in which
they were published (with the exception that in the Discworld chapter the
proper novels come before the secondary material such as the maps and the
**Science of Discworld** books). Within each book, the annotations are sorted
in ascending order by page number, with that number referring to the
edition I actually own myself, which will typically be the original UK
hardcover edition. (Some of the earlier books also list paperback page
numbers – for more information please read the "`Page Numbers`_" section in
the "`Editorial Comments`_" chapter.)

Each annotation is prefixed by either a '+', denoting an annotation that is
new or has been significantly updated in this version of the APF, or a '-',
denoting an unchanged older annotation. This used to be quite handy when
new APF versions appeared more frequently, but has since become a lot less
meaningful. We are sticking to the practice for now, on account of
tradition.

The APF incorporates, in this edition once again more than ever before,
many passages from articles that Terry himself has posted to
alt.fan.pratchett. As a long time active contributor to the group, he often
provides inside information on many aspects of his writing, and it would be
a waste to let this first-hand knowledge just disappear into Usenet
history. Much of this material has been incorporated into the annotations
themselves, but quite a bit of interesting information that did not fit
anywhere else has been collected in the "`Thoughts and Themes`_" chapter.

The APF ends with the already mentioned "`Editorial Comments`_" chapter, where
various nuts & bolts of the editing process are discussed. It also lists
information to help you obtain the most recent version of the APF in
whatever format you prefer.

One particular piece of technical information is so important I am placing
it here as well as at the end, and that is the address to write to if you
have any suggestions, questions, corrections, or new annotations. Without
the enthusiastic reactions and input from its readers, the APF would never
have survived so far. Please mail all your feedback to me at:

      apf@lspace.org

and maybe you will see *your* contribution become a part of the next
edition. I will now leave you to the annotations, and end this introduction
with a thought that is a bit of a cliche but nonetheless true: I hope you
will enjoy reading the APF as much as I have enjoyed putting it together.

Other Annotations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Omens
~~~~~~~~~~

- [cover] The weird blue/red neon thingy surrounding the '666' on the cover
  of the UK hardcover version of "`Good Omens`_" is actually a map of the M25
  London orbital motorway, mentioned in the text as "evidence for the
  hidden hand of Satan in the affairs of Man".

  If you have Internet access, you can get a copy of the "`Good Omens`_" cover
  from the Pratchett Archives.

+ [p. 9/vii] "[...] the angel, whose name was Aziraphale."

  On the subject of the correct pronunciation of the name, Terry says:

  "It *should* be Azz-ear-raf-AE-el, but we got into the habit of
  pronouncing it Azz-ear-raf-ail, so I guess that's the right way now."

  And about the name's origin:

  "It was made up but... er... from real ingredients. [The name] Aziraphale
  could be shoved in a list of 'real' angels and would fit right in..."

  For instance, Islam recognizes the Archangels Jibril, Mikhail, Azrael
  (see also the annotation for p. 7/9 of "`Reaper Man`_"), and Israfel (whom
  Edgar Allan Poe wrote a well-known poem about), whereas from Christianity
  we get such names as Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, and Uriel.

- [p. 11/viii] "It was going to be a dark and stormy night."

  See the annotation for p. 9/7 of "`Soul Music`_".

- [p. 17/1] "Archbishop James Usher (1581-1656) published **Annales Veteris
  Et Novi Testamenti** in 1654, which suggested that the Heaven and the
  Earth were created in 4004 BC."

  This is true in spirit, but almost completely wrong in nit-picking
  detail, which leads me to conclude that Terry and Neil used sloppy
  secondary sources for their research.

  The man's name was spelled Ussher, the book's name was actually **Annales
  Veteris Testamenti** (Annals of the *Old* Testament), it was published in
  1650, and it was Ussher himself who pinpointed the time of creation at
  noon, October 23, 4004 BC – not nine o'clock in the morning.

  For a fascinating explanation of why it would really be very unfair of us
  to ridicule Ussher's findings, I refer the interested reader to the essay
  'Fall in the House of Ussher' by Stephen Jay Gould, which appeared in his
  excellent collection **Eight Little Piggies**.

- [p. 19/3] "[...] all tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight
  metamorphose into 'Best of Queen' albums."

  In an interview in **Comics Buyer's Guide** with Terry and Neil, shortly
  after the American release of "`Good Omens`_", Terry proposed the theory
  that, when you're driving through the country late at night, and there's
  nothing on the radio, you find yourself stopping in at an all-night gas
  station and looking through the tape rack; the only thing there remotely
  tolerable is a **Best of Queen**, so you buy that. Two weeks later you
  can't remember how the thing got there, so you get rid of it, only to go
  through the same process again. Neil's theory was that tapes really do
  turn into **Best of Queen** albums.

- [p. 20/3] "[...] he was currently wondering vaguely who Moey and Chandon
  were".

  The Queen song 'Killer Queen' contains the line: "She keeps the Moet et
  Chandon in a pretty cabinet". Freddie Mercury's pronunciation is indeed
  such that, if you don't already *know* what he's singing, this part of
  the lyrics can be extremely puzzling.

- [p. 26/8] "...I will not let you go (let him go)..."

  This sentence, and the 'scaramouche' line a few paragraphs before, are
  taken from Queen's legendary song 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. This line is
  misquoted though. The actual song goes: "*We* will not let you go (let
  him go)".

- [p. 32/13] "Sister Mary had expected an American diplomat to look like
  Blake Carrington or J.R. Ewing."

  Leading male characters in the 1980s Power Soaps **Dynasty** (Blake
  Carrington played by John Forsythe) and **Dallas** (J. R. Ewing played by
  Larry Hagman). The general image is of somewhat rugged American
  masculinity. In a suit.

  The "`Good Omens`_" paperback replaces "an American diplomat" with "the
  American Cultural Attache".

- [p. 33/13] "With a little old lady as the sleuth, [...]"

  Not a reference to Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, but rather to Angela
  Landsbury's character in the TV show **Murder, She Wrote** (there are not
  many "avuncular sheriffs" in the Miss Marple books).

- [p. 35/15] "He'd seen a Ken Russell film once. There had been nuns in
  it."

  This might have been, for instance, the 1971 film **The Devils**, a study
  of a French nunnery that had supposedly turned to Satanism.

- [p. 37/17] "'Wormwood's a nice name,' said the nun, remembering her
  classics. 'Or Damien. Damien's very popular.'"

  Damien refers to the protagonist of the various **Omen** movies (see the
  annotation for p. 67/40). Wormwood is the name of the junior devil in
  **The Screwtape Letters** by C. S. Lewis. This is a series of letters from
  a senior devil (Screwtape) to a junior devil (Wormwood) about Wormwood's
  attempted temptation of a man in war-time London.

  Wormwood is also the plant which according to tradition sprang up from
  the track of the serpent as it writhed along the ground when it was
  driven out of the Garden of Eden.

- [p. 41/19] "'Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.'"

  A well-known quote from Shakespeare's **The Tempest**, act 1, scene 2.

- [p. 41/19] "That Hieronymus Bosch. What a weirdo."

  Hieronymus Bosch was a 15th century Dutch painter of religious visions
  that dealt in particular with the torments of Hell and the subjects of
  sin and punishment.

- [p. 42/20] "'I don't think there's anything wrong with Errol. *Or*
  Cary.'"

  Errol Flynn and Cary Grant.

- [p. 50/26] "And he had a complete set of the Infamous Bibles,
  individually named from errors in typesetting."

  There have been many Infamous Bibles, and all of the ones mentioned in
  this paragraph, except for the **Charing Cross Bible** and the **Buggre Alle
  This Bible**, actually did exist.

  As usual, it is Brewer who has all the relevant information. The
  **Unrighteous Bible** and the **Wicked Bible** are as Terry and Neil describe
  them. In addition, there is:

  **Discharge Bible**: An edition printed in 1806 containing "discharge" for
  "charge" in 1 Timothy 5:21: "I discharge thee before God [...] that thou
  observe these things [...]".

  **Treacle Bible**: A popular name for the Bishops' Bible, 1568 because in
  it, Jeremiah 8:22 reads "Is there no treacle in Gilead" instead of "Is
  there no balm in Gilead".

  **Standing Fishes Bible**: An edition of 1806 in which Ezekiel 47:10 reads:
  "And it shall come to pass that the fishes [instead of: fishers] shall
  stand upon it."

  Also mentioned by Brewer are the **Ears To Ear Bible**, the **Rosin Bible**
  and the **Rebecca's Camels Bible**.

- [p. 52/28] The three lost Shakespeare plays.

  **The Trapping Of The Mouse** refers to Agatha Christie's **The Mousetrap**
  (which has now been running for more than 42 consecutive years in
  London), who in turn named her play after the play-within-a-play that
  occurs in... **Hamlet**.

  **Golde Diggers Of 1589** refers to the series of movie musicals with
  similar names made in 1933, 1935 and 1937.

  **The Comedie Of Robin Hoode, Or The Forest Of Sherwoode** is not directly
  traceable to something specific, but there have been of course many
  famous Robin Hood movies, from the legendary 1938 production with Errol
  Flynn, Basil Rathbone and Olivia de Havilland through the more
  contemporary 1991 **Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves**, starring Kevin
  Costner.

- [p. 56/31] "'I mean, d'you know what eternity is? There's this big
  mountain, see, a mile high, at the end of the universe, and once every
  thousand years there's this little bird--'"

  Crowley's description of eternity is from the hell-and-damnation speech
  in James Joyce's **Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man**.

+ [p. 62/36] "They were doing drinks in a restaurant called Top of the
  Sixes, on the top of 666 Fifth Avenue, New York."

  The name and address were real when "`Good Omens`_" was written: there
  actually used to be such a restaurant on top of 666 Fifth Avenue.
  Somewhen in the 90s it was closed and converted to a club.

  The rest of the building is of course also still very much in use. On the
  37th floor, for instance, resides **Demon Internet Inc**, the American arm
  of the well-known British Internet Service Provider, which Terry himself
  uses.

- [p. 67/40] "'I am Nanny Astoreth,' she told him."

  Astoreth or Ashtaroth was the Zidonian goddess-moon in Syrian mythology.
  No, I have no idea who the Zidonians were, but undoubtedly they were
  heathens, and therefore presumably on Evil's side by default.

- [p. 67/40] "'What a delightful child,' she said. 'He'll be wanting a
  little tricycle soon.'"

  The 'mother' in the 1976 horror movie **The Omen** (which is all about the
  Antichrist being raised in a normal household) was forced by little
  Damien over the edge of an upstairs railing with his tricycle.

- [p. 68/40] The nursery rhyme Nanny Astoreth sings to Warlock:

    |  Oh, the grand old Duke of York
    |  He had ten thousand men
    |  He marched them up to the top of the hill
    |  And crushed all the nations of the world and brought them
       under the rule of Satan our master.

  is a parody of the English original:

    |  The grand old Duke of York,
    |  He had ten thousand men.
    |  He marched them up to the top of the hill
    |  And he marched them down again.

    |  And when they were up they were up.
    |  And when they were down they were down.
    |  And when they were only half way up
    |  They were neither up nor down.

  Accompanied (in some versions) by fingers marching up the small child as
  appropriate and stopping to tickle for the last line.

- [p. 68/40] "'Bwuvver Fwancis the gardener says I mus' selfwesswy pwactise
  virtue an' wuv to all wivving things,' said Warlock."

  The gardener is none other than Saint Francis of Assisi. Note also the
  "flocks of birds settled all over him at every opportunity" bit earlier
  on.

- [p. 70/42] "The message had come during **Cheers**, one of Crowley's
  favourite television programmes. Woody the barman had [...]"

  In the American edition of "`Good Omens`_", this scene was changed to refer
  to the series **The Golden Girls** and the character Rose. (The effect
  remains the same).

  Nobody knows the reason for this change, since both are American sitcoms
  anyway. Speaking personally, I think Crowley is definitely a **Cheers**
  person, and would *not* have liked **The Golden Girls** at all.

- [p. 75/43] "He had attended a class in the 1870s run by John Maskelyne
  [...]"

  John Maskelyne was a 19th century stage magician who specialised in
  sleight-of-hand illusions. He is fondly remembered in the illusionist
  community as a mentor to aspiring young magicians. He also gained some
  notoriety for exposing fraudulent spiritualists.

- [p. 78/46] "'I-should-be-so-lucky, -lucky-lucky-lucky-lucky,'"

  This is the chorus to Kylie Minogue's break-through hit 'I should be so
  lucky':

    |   I should be so lucky
    |   Lucky lucky lucky
    |   I should be so lucky in love

  Notice that this is yet another misquote: there are only *four*
  successive 'lucky's, not five.

- [p. 79/46] The scenes of Adam growing up in Tadfield are an affectionate
  parody of the **Just William** books by Richmal Crompton.

  They are a series of books about William Brown (age 11) and his gang of
  Outlaws: Ginger, Douglas and Henry. The Johnsonites in "`Good Omens`_"
  parallel the Laneites in **Just William**, Hubert Lane being a similarly
  lugubrious podgy kid.

- [p. 82/49] "'I'll call him Dog,' said his Master, positively."

  There's a nice resonance here with the biblical Adam giving names to all
  the animals in God's creation (Genesis 2:19).

- [p. 87/52] 'Another One Bites The Dust', 'We Are The Champions', 'I Want
  To Break Free' and 'Fat-Bottomed Girls' are all songs by Queen (see the
  annotation for p. 20/3).

  Queen fans have pointed out that at the time "`Good Omens`_" was released,
  there was no (or at least no easily available) Queen greatest hits album
  that actually contained all of these songs. A recently released double
  album has remedied this situation.

- [p. 94/58] "'It's probably compline, unless that's a slimming aid.'"

  No, compline is indeed one of the periods of the religious day (around
  18.00 h, according to my copy of **The Name of the Rose**). The slimming
  aid is 'complan'.

- [p. 103/65] "The contingent from Financial Planning were lying flat on
  their faces in what had once been the haha, although they weren't very
  amused."

  If you don't know what a haha is, see the annotation for p. 77/58 of "`Men
  at Arms`_".

- [p. 110/70] "...Bee-elzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me..."

  Another line from Queen's **Bohemian Rhapsody**.

- [p. 114/73] "**The Nice And Accurate Prophecies** made the **Hitler Diaries**
  look like, well, a bunch of forgeries."

  **Stern** magazine published a series of Hitler's diaries in the mid-80s
  which, in fact, turned out to be forgeries.

- [p. 116/75] "[...] Elvis was taken by Space Aliens in 1976 because he was
  too good for this world."

  Actually, Elvis died in 1977, so perhaps these Space Aliens left a
  doppelgaenger? Neil and Terry are certainly aware of the correct year,
  because later on (p. 261/177, during the video trivia game scene) there
  is a reference to both Bing Crosby and Marc Bolan dying in 1976. But in
  fact, both died in 1977 as well.

- [p. 122/79] "'This wouldn't of happened if we'd of gone to Torremolinos
  like we usually do,' [...]"

  Torremolinos is a resort on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, which in
  the past was very popular with the more down-market sort of British
  holiday-maker. In US terms, imagine Atlantic City/Las Vegas. Take it down
  market a bit. A bit more. No, a bit more than that. There. That's
  beginning to get close to Torremolinos. The town has in recent years made
  a great effort to change its image and attract a better class of tourist
  but whether this has worked remains doubtful.

- [p. 127/80] "[...] the frequent name changes usually being prompted by
  whatever Adam had happened to have read [...]"

  The Hole-in-the-Chalk gang refers to Butch Cassidy's Hole-in-the-Wall
  Gang, The Really Well-Known Four to The Famous Five, The Legion of Really
  Super-Heroes to DC Comics' **Legion of Super-Heroes** series, The Justice
  Society of Tadfield to DC's **Justice Society of America**.

- [p. 129/81] "Pepper's given first names were Pippin Galadriel Moonchild."

  Both Pippin and Galadriel are characters from Tolkien's **The Lord of the
  Rings** (although Pippin is actually a male hobbit). Terry explains that
  Pepper's names are not really a parody of hippie practices:

  "It's an observation. I have *signed books* for two Galadriels at least
  – and three Bilboes. Your basic hippy is fairly predictable."

- [p. 137/88] "'I bet ole Torturemada dint have to give up jus' when he was
   getting started [...]'"

  Tomas de Torquemada, Spanish inquisitor-general notorious for his
  cruelty. He was largely responsible for the expulsion of the Jews from
  Spain around 1492.

- [p. 147/95] "Where the reactor should have been was an empty space. You
  could have had quite a nice game of squash in it."

  For the connection between nuclear reactors and squash courts, see the
  annotation for p. 156/138 of "`Reaper Man`_".

- [p. 154/98] "Sable signed for it, his real name – one word, seven
  letters. Sounds like examine."

  But, as many alert readers have noticed, the word 'famine' only has six
  letters. Terry says: "Oh, yeah. The famous seven-lettered six letter
  name. [...] It's like this. In the original MS, it was six letters,
  because we can both count. And it was six letters in the Gollancz
  hardcover. And six letters in the Workman US hardcover. And became seven
  in the Corgi edition. No-one knows why."

- [p. 155/99] "'An' there was this man called Charles Fort,' he said. 'He
  could make it rain fish and frogs and stuff.'"

  Charles Fort lived in the first half of this century and made a career
  out of attacking established scientific convictions and practitioners,
  mostly by collecting and publishing book after book of scientifically
  unexplainable occurrences and phenomena such as, indeed, accounts of
  rains of fish, etc.

  Although Fort and his Fortean Society cheerfully collected and proposed
  vast numbers of crackpot theories, Charles Fort was by no means a
  crackpot himself. He just wanted to attack and needle the scientific
  establishment using every possible means at his disposal.

  For more information about Fort I refer the reader to Martin Gardner's
  wonderful book **Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science** (1957), or to
  the Fortean Society's newspaper **The Fortean Times**, still being
  published in both UK and US today.

- [p. 156/100] "[...] a highly successful film series with lasers, robots
  and a princess who wore her hair like a pair of stereo headphones(TM)."

  This is of course the **Star Wars** saga, directed by George Lucas. The
  princess is Princess Leia Organa; and the person with the coal scuttle
  helmet who is allowed to blow up planets is Darth Vader.

+ [p. 160/103] "If Cortez, on his peak in Darien, had had slightly damp
  feet [...]"

  From **On First Looking into Chapman's Homer** by John Keats, where the
  experience of reading Chapman's translation of Homer is compared to the
  feeling Cortez must have had:

    |   Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
    |   When a new planet swims into his ken
    |   Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes
    |   He stared at the Pacific – and all his men
    |   Looked at each other with a wild surmise
    |   Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

  (Actually, Keats was mixing up Cortez (who conquered Mexico, and was the
  first European to look upon Mexico City) with Balboa (who climbed Darien,
  and was the first European to see the Pacific from the east).

- [p. 161/104] "[...] eight other people [...] two of them [...] and one of
  the other six [...]"

  Or at least, that's what it says in my hardcover version and in the
  American trade paperback. In the English paperback, however, the quote
  says "one of the other *five*" (italics mine), which is of course rather
  confusing, since two plus five usually equals seven, not eight.

  Terry says: "[...] we got the *numbers* right – I checked the original
  MS. This is another manifestation of the strange numbers glitch (remember
  *famine*, the seven letter word?)"

  See the annotation for p. 154/98 for the 'famine' glitch Terry refers to.

- [p. 165/107] "[...] people called Grasshopper, little old men sitting on
  mountains, other people learning kung-fu in ancient temples [...]"

  David Carradine's character Kwai-Chang Caine was given the nickname
  'Grasshopper' by his mentor, Master Po, in the television series **Kung
  Fu**.

  Incidentally, the head of the Shaolin monastery where Caine studied was
  Chen Ming Kan, and the subsidiary monks were the masters Shun, Teh, Yuen,
  Wong, Sun and, already mentioned, Po.

  If you are the kind of person who enjoys learning this type of
  mindboggling trivia, then *run*, don't walk to your bookstore, and buy
  the **Straight Dope** books by Cecil Adams. Your life will be vastly
  enriched. There is even a Pratchett connection as well: Terry uses the
  **Straight Dope** books as reference works.

- [p. 167/109] "There is no longer a real Witchfinder General."

  Just for the record: the story as Terry and Neil give it in this section
  is entirely true. Matthew Hopkins existed, and was indeed hanged as a
  witch himself. I am told he was portrayed fairly accurately by Vincent
  Price in the film **The Conqueror Worm**, aka **Witchfinder General**.

- [p. 167/109] "There is also, now, a Witchfinder Private. His name is
  Newton Pulsifer."

  The name 'Lucifer' means "bringer of light". One particular meaning of
  'pulse' is a legume – a pea or lentil. Therefore, 'Pulsifer' means
  "bringer of peace (peas)".

  I have no idea if this is truly what Terry and Neil intended, but it is a
  beautifully convoluted pun, regardless.

- [p. 171/112] "Newt [...] blushed crimson as he performed the obligatory
  nipple-count on page three".

  American readers should be aware that some English tabloid papers
  traditionally showed a photo of a topless girl on page three, although I
  am told these days only **The Sun** still follows this practice.

- [p. 172/113] "'Women wi' too many arms.'"

  Refers to the Hindu goddess Kali (although quite a few more Hindu gods
  and goddesses have more than the usual allotment of arms – Shiva comes
  to mind).

  Two lines further down there is a reference to Baron Saturday, who is of
  course our old friend Baron Samedi (see the annotation for p. 179/157 of
  "`Witches Abroad`_").

- [p. 188/123] "Red sky in the morning. It was going to rain."

  See the annotation for p. 202/197 of "`Equal Rites`_".

- [p. 192/126] "Newt's car was a Wasabi."

  'Wasabi' is, in fact, a kind of horseradish used in sushi.

- [p. 193/127] "[...] the world's only surviving Wasabi agent in
  Nigirizushi, Japan."

  And 'Nigirizushi' *is* a kind of sushi.

+ [p. 197/129] "The one that looked like a pepper pot just skidded down it,
  and fell over at the bottom. The other two ignored its frantic beeping
  [...]"

  The Daleks in the television series **Dr Who** are robots that look very
  much like pepper pots. They don't beep much, though.

  R2D2 in the movie **Star Wars** (and sequels) is a robot that does a lot of
  frantic beeping. It doesn't look that much like a pepper pot, though.

  (In an earlier release of the APF, this annotation listed only R2D2 as a
  possibility. I received a steady trickle of mail saying: "no, you're
  wrong, it's a reference to the Daleks". So I changed the annotation,
  which of course only led to the steady trickle changing into: "no, you're
  wrong, it's a reference to R2D2". Clearly, we have a controversy on our
  hands...)

- [p. 205/136] "[...] a wall clock with a free-swinging pendulum that E. A.
  Poe would cheerfully have strapped someone under."

  See the annotation for p. 15/16 of "`Reaper Man`_".

- [p. 217/144] "'And then giant ants take over the world,' said Wensleydale
  nervously. 'I saw this film. Or you go around with sawn-off shotguns and
  everyone's got these cars with, you know, knives and guns stuck on –'"

  The films Wensleydale is referring to are **Them!** (how appropriate...)
  and the various **Mad Max** movies.

- [p. 227/152] "The Kappamaki, a whaling research ship, [...]"

  'Kappamaki' is a Japanese cucumber roll.

- [p. 233/157] "'There doesn't have to be any of that business with one
  third of the seas turning to blood or anything,' said Aziraphale
  happily."

  To the few particularly befuddled or atheistic readers out there who at
  this point of the book still aren't quite sure what is going on, I can
  only give the advice to take a closer look at Chapter 6 of the biblical
  Book of Revelation.

- [p. 235/158] "Hi. This is Anthony Crowley. Uh. I –"

  Up to this point in the novel, we have only been told that Crowley's
  first name begins with an 'A', leading to the false expectation that his
  name might be Aleister Crowley, as in the famous British mystic,
  theosophist, black-arts practitioner and "most evil man on Earth".

- [p. 246/166] "'This is a Sainsbury's plant-mister, cheapest and most
  efficient plant-mister in the world. It can squirt a fine spray of water
  into the air.'"

  Dirty Harry again. See the annotation for p. 136/124 of "`Guards!
  Guards!`_".

- [p. 257/174] "'"Puppet on a String"! Sandie Shaw! Honest. I'm bleeding
  positive!'"

  American readers will probably not realise that this is the answer to the
  question: "What song by which artist won the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest
  for Britain?"

- [p. 258/174] "'1666!' 'No, you great pillock! That was the fire! The
  Plague was 1665!'"

  The Great Fire of London in 1666 helped to wipe out the bubonic plague
  that had been afflicting the city since 1665.

- [p. 258/175] "He had LOVE tattooed on one set of knuckles, HATE on the
  other."

  Originally, this movie reference dates back to Robert Mitchum in **Night
  of the Hunter**. Later it was used by many, many others, including Marlon
  Brando in **The Wild One**, Meatloaf in **The Rocky Horror Picture Show** (an
  appearance entirely built around Brando's), and more recently by Robert
  de Niro in the remake of **Cape Fear**.

  And then there's **The Blues Brothers**, where Jake has his name tattooed
  across the knuckles of one hand, while Elwood needs both hands to spell
  his name; **The Simpsons**, where Sideshow Bob (who, like most cartoon
  characters has only three fingers and a thumb) has LUV on one set of
  knuckles and HAT (with a line across the A) on the other; and of course
  **The Last Remake of Beau Geste** (see also the annotation for p. 109/82)
  where Peter Ustinov, as the sadistic sergeant, has a scene where he sits
  with one hand partially obscured. We get the impression that he too has
  HATE and LOVE tattooed on his knuckles. Eventually he moves, and reveals
  the tattoos actually read HATE and LOATHE.

- [p. 259/175] "'I haven't seen you since Mafeking,' said Red."

  Mafeking, located near Bophuthatswana in South Africa, was for 80 years
  the administrative headquarters of the British Protectorate of
  Bechuanaland (now Botswana). It was the starting point of the Jameson
  Raid, a disastrous raid into the Boer Republic of the Transvaal in 1895,
  which led to the South African War of 1899.

- [p. 263/179] "'Ere, I seen you before,' he said. 'You was on the cover of
  that Blue Oyster Cult album."

  This would be **Some Enchanted Evening** (1978), the Blue Oyster Cult's
  second live album. Death painted by T. R. Shorr.

  See also the annotation for p. 239 of "Hogfather_".

- [p. 265/180] The name Citron Deux-Chevaux refers to the Citroen 2CV, or
  deux-chevaux as it is commonly called in Europe ("chevaux" means horses
  – 'CV' has a (very loose) connection with horsepower).

- [p. 268/182] "'Just phone 0800-CASH and pledge your donation now.'"

  A transatlantic amalgamation of British and American telephone number
  formats.

- [p. 270/184] "...**All we need is, Radio Gaga**... sang Freddie Mercury."

  Terry and Neil definitely seem to have trouble rendering songs correctly.
  According to my source (I can't *stand* the bloody song myself) the line
  that does appear in the song goes: "All we *hear* is, Radio Gaga".

- [p. 277/189] "[...] formerly Curl Up and Dye, [...]"

  People have noticed that this name also occurs in the **Blues Brothers**
  movie, but Terry assures us that the name goes back much further than
  that, and that there in fact at one time actually existed a hair dresser
  named like this.

  I have subsequently been informed that currently existing 'Curl Up and
  Dye' hairdressers can be found in both Birmingham and Chepstow.

- [p. 280/191] **Sprechen Sie Deutsch** and **Parlez-vous Francais** are German
  and French respectively for "do you speak German/French", but "Wo bu hui
  jiang zhongwen" is Chinese for "I can't speak Chinese".

  Terry says: "The bit of Chinese was Neil's. I said, "Are you sure it
  means 'Do you speak Chinese?'" He said yes. I should argue?"

- [p. 287/196] "'*You're thinking that any second now this head is going to
  go round and round, and I'm going to start vomiting pea soup.*'"

  This is an obvious reference to Linda Blair in **The Exorcist**.

- [p. 288/197] "Something about sheets of glass falling off lorries and
  slicing people's heads off, as he recalled [...]"

  The film referred to is **The Omen**.

- [p. 296/203] "'Heigh ho,' said Anthony Crowley, and just drove anyway."

  This refers to an old British topical song about the Italian opera-singer
  Antonio Rolli, well-known in London during the Regency. The song was
  called 'A Frog He Would-a Wooing Go', and the chorus has the lines:

    |   With a rolypoly, gammon and spinach,
    |   Heigh ho, said Anthony Rowley.

  This was intended to be a highly amusing satire on the way Italian people
  speak. It has only survived to this day as a children's rhyme because of
  its references to talking animals, and despite a totally confusing
  chorus.

- [p. 296/203] "What she really wanted to be was an internationally
  glamorous jet-setter, but she didn't have the O-levels."

  This has to do with the British education system. After the 8th grade you
  decide how many two-year O- (Ordinary) level courses you are going to
  take (each with an exam at the end). Most non-minimum wage jobs ask for
  at least 5 O-levels, people in college usually have 7 or 8. After your
  O-levels you can either leave school or go on for A- (Advanced) level
  courses, which take another 2-3 years.

  These days, O-levels are no longer a part of the British education
  system, having been replaced a few years back by the GCSE (General
  Certificate of Secondary Education). A-levels still exist.

- [p. 297/204] "[...] they burrowed into eyes, noses, ears, lights [...]"

  'Lights' is colloquial British for 'internal organs'. See the annotation
  for p. 64/62 of "Pyramids_".

- [p. 303/208] "'There's a red sky,' he said [...] 'Or is it shepherds who
  are delighted at night? I can never remember.'"

  See the annotations for p. 202/197 of "`Equal Rites`_" and p. 174/126 of
  "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 310/214] "There was also a man selling hot dogs."

  Bet you even money his initials were C.M.O.T...

- [p. 326/226] "'Where *is* Armageddon, anyway?'"

  One theory holds that 'Armageddon' is a Greek translation for a Hebrew
  word that may have meant 'the mountain of Megiddo', in reference to Mount
  Carmel, which overlooks the plain of Megiddo, where many Old Testament
  battles were fought.

- [p. 334/232] "'Did any of them kids have some space alien with a face
  like a friendly turd in a bike basket?'"

  A reference to the telekinetic bike-riding scene at the end of the movie
  **E.T.**.

- [p. 348/242] "'You think wars get started because some old duke gets
  shot, or someone cuts off someone's ear, or someone's sited their
  missiles in the wrong place.'"

  That the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand in
  Sarajevo in 1914 sparked the beginning of World War I, and that the
  Soviet placement of missiles on Cuba in 1962 almost led to World War III
  is common knowledge. But to non-Brits the second reference may not be so
  obvious. In 1739 Capt Robert Jenkins, of the brig **Rebecca**, claimed to
  have been attacked by a Spanish ship and to have had his ear cut off. He
  complained to the king on his return to England, the incident was taken
  up by the general public, and the Prime Minister used it as a pretext to
  go to war with Spain to regain control of shipping routes. This war is
  generally referred to as the War of Jenkins' Ear.

- [p. 349/243] "'Beelzebub,' Crowley supplied. 'He's the Lord of –'"

  Crowley is trying to say 'Lord of the Flies', which is the literal
  meaning of the Hebrew word 'Beelzebub'.

- [p. 355/248] Dick Turpin is the name of a famous British highwayman.
  Hence the joke about Newt's car being called 'Dick Turpin': "'Because
  everywhere I go, I hold up traffic,' he mumbled wretchedly."

- [p. 374/262] "They went to the Ritz again [...]. And, [...] for the first
  time ever, a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square."

  From the song 'A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square':

    |   That certain night, the night we met
    |   There was magic abroad in the air
    |   There were angels dining at the Ritz
    |   And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

- [p. 375/262] The **Necrotelecomnicom** also appears (but spelled
  'Necrotelicomnicom') in the Discworld books.

  See the annotation for p. 111/109 of "`Equal Rites`_").

- [p. 375/262] The **Malleus Maleficarum** is the name of an existing 15th
  century guidebook for witch-hunters, written by Heinrich Kramer and
  Joseph Sprenger (one a Dominican Inquisitor, the other the Mayor of
  Cologne), two high-ranking officials of the Catholic church. This book
  apparently became Europe's first best-seller after the invention of the
  printing press, and the (early 20th century) English translation of this
  book, **The Hammer of Witches**, is still in print today.

- [p. 377/264] "It was Sunday afternoon."

  According to Terry, the U.S. edition of "`Good Omens`_" has about 700 extra
  words in it, because:

  "After the MS had been accepted and edited by Gollancz, the *American*
  editor at Workman in NY asked for a couple of things for the US edition,
  one of which related to Warlock.

  He was an American boy, you see, and she was certain that Americans would
  want to know what had happened to him. So we said ok, and wrote it. To
  the best of my recollection that was the biggest change, although there
  were other minor additions (some we were able to slip into the Gollancz
  hardcover at proof stage, but the Warlock bit was too long). I have to
  say we also polished things up here and there, too, although I think we
  were able to transfer most of *those* changes to the UK proofs too.

  And then since the one done for Workman was technically the final MS the
  UK paperback was set from it."

  For the people owning the British hardcover of "`Good Omens`_", here is the
  text of the added section:

  "It was Sunday afternoon.

  High over England a 747 droned westwards. In the first-class cabin a boy
  called Warlock put down his comic and stared out of the window.

  It had been a very strange couple of days. He still wasn't certain why
  his father had been called to the Middle East. He was pretty sure that
  his father didn't know, either. It was probably something cultural. All
  that happened was a lot of funny-looking guys with towels on their heads
  and very bad teeth had shown them around some old ruins. As ruins went,
  Warlock had seen better. And then one of the old guys had said to him,
  wasn't there anything he wanted to do? And Warlock said he'd like to
  leave.

  They'd looked very unhappy about that.

  And now he was going back to the States. There had been some sort of
  problem with tickets or flights or airport destinations--boards or
  something. It was weird; he was pretty sure his father had meant to go
  back to England. Warlock liked England. It was a nice country to be an
  American in.

  The plane was at that point passing right above the Lower Tadfield
  bedroom of Greasy Johnson, who was aimlessly leafing through a
  photography magazine that he'd bought merely because it had a rather good
  picture of a tropical fish on the cover.

  A few pages below Greasy's listless finger was a spread on American
  football, and how it was really catching on in Europe. Which was
  odd--because when the magazine had been printed, those pages had been
  about photography in desert conditions.

  It was about to change his life.

  And Warlock flew on to America. He deserved *something* (after all, you
  never forgot the first friends you ever had, even if you were all a few
  hours old at the time) and the power that was controlling the fate of all
  mankind at that precise time was thinking: Well, he's going to *America*,
  isn't he? Don't see how you could have anythin' better than going to
  *America*.

  They've got thirty-nine flavors of ice cream there. Maybe even more."

- [p. 383/267] "And if you want to imagine the future, imagine a boot...
  no, imagine a trainer, laces trailing, kicking a pebble; [...]"

  From George Orwell's _1984`_": "If you want to imagine the future, imagine
  a boot stamping on a human face forever". A 'trainer' is what the British
  call a 'sneaker', but I should think that much was clear from context (in
  the paperback, 'trainer' has in fact been replaced by 'sneaker').

- [p. 383/268] "Slouching hopefully towards Tadfield."

  From W. B. Yeats' poem **The Second Coming**:

    |   And what rough beast, its hour come round at last
    |   Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

- Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman did have the title _668 – The Neighbour
  of the Beast`_" on hand for a "`Good Omens`_" sequel, but since Neil Gaiman
  lives in the US now, Terry says: "I can't see it ever being written".

  There are many documented occurrences of this joke in other contexts, by
  the way (including a recently released actual novel with this name), some
  of them predating "`Good Omens`_". Terry again points out that it's only to
  be expected since the joke is so obvious.

- There is a British KitKat chocolate bar TV commercial that predates "`Good
  Omens`_", and which involves an angel and a devil who are just starting
  their respective coffee breaks. Both exit from separate elevators, the
  angel accompanied by several pure-white animals, while the devil turns
  back into his elevator and screams, in a British accent, "Shut up!" to
  whatever demons are causing a ruckus behind him.

  If you are now thinking that this is an extremely unlikely, farfetched
  annotation – well, so did I, until Terry Pratchett himself gave us the
  following piece of information (when some folks were having further
  discussions on how old this ad exactly was):

  "I'm pretty sure [this ad] started about the same time as "`Good Omens`_",
  because:

  One night I was sitting there typing away when I looked up and there the
  angel and the devil were, having a teabreak (it's not really a
  particularly "`Good Omens`_" idea, but I know why people like it...) And I
  thought, hey, great...

  And about half an hour later there was an ad (some UK viewers might
  remember it) for an insurance company which showed a businessman with
  wide angel wings walking down the street...

  And then, just when I was doing the bit where Crowley muses that people
  are much better than demons at thinking up horrible things to do to one
  another, I switched on the radio; there was a performance of **The
  Tempest**, and someone said "Hell is empty and all the devils are here".
  It was a weird evening, really."

- People have been wondering (a) where the back cover photograph of "`Good
  Omens`_" was taken, and (b) which one of them is Terry Pratchett.

  Terry provides the answer to both questions: "In Kensal Green Cemetery,
  one frosty January day. Since white clothes tend to be thinner than dark
  clothes, I had to be stood in front of a blowlamp between shots."

  Kensal Green Cemetery can be found in West London, fairly near to
  Wormwood Scrubs Prison. It is one of the seven or so cemeteries built
  around the edge of central London in the nineteenth century to cope with
  the large cholera outbreaks. They are large purpose-built efforts, and
  are full of the glorious stonemasonry that the Victorians indulged in to
  glorify themselves.

  The photograph of Terry and Neil appears on the back of the UK hardcover,
  and in black and white on the inside of the Corgi paperback. If you have
  Internet access, you can get a copy of the photograph from the Pratchett
  Archives.


Strata
~~~~~~

- The whole book is, in a very general way, modelled on Larry Niven's
  classic **Ringworld** novel: a group of differently-raced beings explore an
  improbable, artificial world and try to find its mysterious builders.

  Terry explains:

  "I intended Strata to be as much a (pisstake/homage/satire) on Ringworld
  as, say, Bill the Galactic Hero was of Starship Troopers. All Niven's
  heroes are competent and all his technology works for millions of
  years... but he's a nice guy and says he enjoyed the book."

- [p. 12/13] "Her skin was presently midnight-black [...]"

  Previous editions of the APF considered this sentence proof of a true
  Josh Kirby goof-up, since he pictured Kin Arad as a Caucasian woman on
  the "Strata_" cover.

  However, it had totally escaped my attention that on p. 22/26 we read:
  "Now her skin was silver [...]", indicating that skin-colour is not a
  permanent attribute for Kin – by the time the scene from the cover is
  reached she could well have changed her skin colour to white.

  On the other hand, after Kin is captured by the locals, Silver suggests
  that she claim to be an Ethiopian princess, so presumably her skin color
  was dark at the time, and Josh Kirby didn't read carefully enough after
  all...

- [p. 21/25] "Back and forth, crossing and leaping, the robots danced their
  caretaker Morris."

  I think this is the earliest reference to Morris dancing in a Terry
  Pratchett novel. See also the "`...and Dance`_" section in Chapter 5.

+ [p. 130] "Kin rose like a well-soaped Venus Anadyomene [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 128/127 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 76/92] "To introduce phase two Kin began to whistle the old
  robot-Morris tune *Mrs Widgery's Lodger*."

  'Mrs Widgery's Lodger' is a perfect name for a non-existent Morris tune.
  While not seeming to be a direct takeoff on any actual tune name, it
  calls several to mind: 'Blue-Eyed Stranger', 'Mrs Casey', and 'Old Woman
  Tossed Up in a Blanket', for instance. 'Mrs Widgery's Lodger' would also
  resurface later on the Discworld as one of the eight orders of wizardry.
  For more information, see the 'Unseen University' entry in the "`The Discworld
  Companion`_".

- [p. 107/132] "'Cape illud, fracturor', [...]"

  Dog-Latin which roughly translates to "Take this, buster".


The Dark Side Of The Sun
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Just as "Strata_" borrows from Larry Niven, so does **The Dark Side of the
  Sun** pay homage to the famous SF-writer Isaac Asimov.

- [p. 5/5] "The Lights In The Sky Are Photofloods"

   **The Lights in the Sky are Stars** is the title of a science fiction
   novel by Fredric Brown (who was most famous for his 'twisted-ending'
   short-short stories, but who is unfortunately almost completely
   forgotten today).

- [p. 6/6] The best dagon fishers could ride a shell with their toes.

  For an explanation of the word 'dagon' see the annotation for p. 197/149
  of "`Men at Arms`_".

- [p. 24/28] "'Probability math predicts the future.'"

  A parallel to Asimov's psychohistory in the **Foundation Series**.

- [p. 27/31] The robot Isaac is obviously modelled on Asimov's well-known
  positronic robots (and less obviously inspired by a similar robot that
  appears in Robert Sheckley's **Dimension of Miracles**). Isaac [the robot]
  follows a more extended version of Asimov's equally famous 'Three Laws of
  Robotics', though: on p. 53/62: "'[...] Eleventh Law of Robotics, Clause
  C, As Amended,' said the robot firmly."

- [p. 42/49] "'Beng take them!'"

  Beng is Romany (Gypsy language) for the Devil.

- [p. 44/52] "'In a few days it'll be Soul Cake Friday, and also the Eve of
  Small Gods,' she said."

  These are of course religious festivals on the Discworld as well, though
  the Soul Cake festivities moved to a different day there (see the
  annotation for p. 289/262 of "`Guards! Guards!`_"). Later in the book, on p.
  89/106, Hogswatchnight is also mentioned.

- [p. 73/87] "'It has been impossible for the Bank to be physically present
  here today, Roche limits being what they are, but [...]'"

  The Roche limit has to do with tidal pull on an object. It specifies how
  close a satellite can orbit a planet before it's pulled apart by tidal
  forces. It stands to reason that the First Sirian Bank, being a planet
  seven thousand miles in diameter, is a bit wary of Roche limits.

- [p. 74/89] "'And I wish to notify the Joker Institute that I have located
  a Joker building, description and position as noted.'"

  Absolutely no relation, I'm sure, to Larry Niven's Slavers.

- [p. 117/140] "That was another Joker achievement, the Maze on Minos."

  Minos was the name of the King of Crete who commissioned Daedalus to
  build the famous Labyrinth to house the Minotaur.

- [p. 118/141] "'Born of the sun, we travel a little way towards the sun,'
  misquoted Isaac, tactlessly."

  Isaac is misquoting the last two lines of the poem **I Think Continually**
  by the English poet Stephen Spender:

    |   Born of the sun, they travelled a short while towards the sun,
    |   And left the vivid air signed with their honour.

- [p. 133/159] "It was a skit [...] written in early Greek style. [...]
  Chorus: 'Brekekekex, co-ax, co-axial'"

  The play being performed is an updated version of Old Attic Comedy, as
  written by the poet Aristophanes. This section specifically parodies
  Aristophanes' **The Frogs**, in which a chorus of (logically enough) frogs
  sings an onomatopoeic song involving the lyric: "Brekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax".

  I am told that Steven Sondheim once wrote a musical version of "The
  Frogs", which was performed in a swimming pool at Yale University with
  both Sigourney Weaver and Meryl Streep in the chorus.


Truckers
~~~~~~~~

- [cover] The drawing of the old nome Torrit (the one holding the Thing) in
  Josh Kirby's cover for this book is actually a caricature of Terry
  Pratchett himself.

- [p. 12/12] "Masklin scanned the lorry park."

  The name Masklin is a pun on the word 'masculine'. Duh.

- [p. 47/44] "[...] the long argument they'd had about the chicken boxes
  with the pictures of the old man with the big whiskers on them."

  Refers to Colonel Sanders, symbol for the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain of
  fast-food chicken restaurants.

- [p. 55/51] "'Life, but not as we know it.'"

  Refers to another cliche **Star Trek** phrase, also parodied in the **Star
  Trekkin'** song by The Firm (see the annotation for p. 84/78 of "`Johnny
  and the Dead`_").

- [p. 58/53] "'Um. It was my idea of what an Outsider would look like, you
  see,' said Dorcas."

  This whole scene immediately made me think of the American pulp science
  fiction magazines, which would often feature elaborate drawings
  depicting, for example, what a Martian might 'scientifically' look like.

  In fact, I have in my possession a 1965 issue of **Fantastic Stories**,
  featuring on the cover a reprint of a 1939 painting by Frank R. Paul
  called 'The Man from Mars', with an accompanying explanation that Dorcas'
  description of the Outsiders is almost an exact equivalent of. This
  Martian has, for instance, disk-shaped suction feet (because of Mars'
  lesser gravity), very big ears (because of the thin atmosphere making it
  harder to catch sounds), white fur and retractable eyes because of the
  extreme cold, etc. etc.

- [p. 76/70] "'Unless you know how to read books properly, they inflame the
  brain, they say.'"

  Everything we learn about the Stationeri, from the audience with the
  Abbot to this point about censorship, indicates a fairly obvious parody
  of the Roman Catholic Church during the time that the Holy Office (which
  oversaw censorship) was in power.

- [p. 103/94] The Store will be closed down and replaced by "an Arnco Super
  Saverstore in the Neil Armstrong Shopping Mall".

  The Neil Armstrong Shopping Mall is also prominently featured as the
  place where Johnny and his friends hang out in the 'Johnny' books, thus
  establishing firmly that the Nomes and Johnny inhabit the same universe
  (see also the annotation for p. 191/175).

- [p. 130/119] "'Breaker Break Good Buddy. Smoky. Double Egg And Chips And
  Beans. Yorkiebar. Truckers.'"

  A 'Yorkie Bar' is a brand of chocolate bar sold in England. Very chunky,
  like one of the thick Hershey bars: Solid Chocolate. Due to a series of
  adverts depicting a truck driver carrying on through the night, etc.
  etc., all because he has his chunky milk chocolate to hand, the words
  'Yorkie Bar' instantly summon up 'Long Distance Lorry Driver' to any
  Briton.

- [p. 132/121] "'Angalo has landed,' he said."

  Pun on "The Eagle has landed".

- [p. 133/122] "'It's a small step for a man, but a giant leap for
  nomekind.'"

  In the category Bloody Obvious References, this is of course a reference
  to Neil Armstrong's first words on the occasion of being the first man on
  the moon: "That's one small step for [a] man, but a giant leap for
  mankind".

- [p. 145/133] "[...] he walked proudly, with a strange swaying motion,
  like a nome who has boldly gone where no nome has gone before and can't
  wait to be asked about it."

  **Star Trek** reference. See the annotation for p. 221/191 for "`The Colour
  of Magic`_".

- [p. 154/141] "'Amazing things, levers. Give me a lever long enough, and a
  firm enough place to stand, and I could move the Store.'"

  Another reference to the famous Archimedes quote. See the annotation for
  p. 139/101 of "`Small Gods`_".

- [p. 171/157] "He recalled the picture of Gulliver. [...] it would be nice
  to think that nomes could agree on something long enough to be like the
  little people in the book..."

  If it's been a while since you actually read Swift, the rather bitter
  irony of Masklin's musings may escape you. The point being that the
  Lilliputters in **Gulliver's Travels** were anything but capable of
  "agreeing on something long enough"; in fact they were waging a
  generation-spanning civil war with each other over the burning question
  of whether one should open one's breakfast egg at the pointy end or at
  the flat end.

  Eventually, the 'little-endian' vs. 'big-endian' feud carried over into
  the world of computing as well, where it refers to the order in which
  bytes in multi-byte numbers should be stored, most-significant first (big
  endian) or least-significant first (little endian).

- [p. 191/175] "'– Anyone seeing the vehicle should contact Grimethorpe
  police on –'"

  Minor inconsistency: by the time we get to the second book in the Nome
  trilogy, the place of action has been retconned from Grimethorpe to
  Blackbury (which is the place where Johnny lives, see the annotation for
  p. 103/94).

  A possible explanation might be that there already *is* a real place
  called Grimethorpe (in Yorkshire), and that Terry'd rather use a
  fictional setting after all.


Diggers
~~~~~~~

- [title] **Diggers**

  In the Corgi paperback editions I have, "Diggers_" and "Wings_" are
  subtitled "The Second [respectively Third] Book Of The Nomes".

  Apparently, in the first edition(s), the trilogy was called **The
  Bromeliad** (and the last two books accordingly subtitled).

  This refers to the central theme of the frogs living in a bromeliad, but
  is also a pun on **The Belgariad**, a well-known fantasy series by David
  Eddings. And of course both names have their origin in Homer's **Iliad**.

  This subtitle was dropped from the British editions, because the editor
  didn't like it. In the US, there were no objections, so to this day US
  editions of the Nome trilogy are subtitled **The Bromeliad**.

- People have commented on the similarity between the Nome trilogy and
  other childrens stories involving "little people". In particular, the
  question has arisen a few times whether Terry was inspired by the
  **Borrowers** books.

  Terry answers: "I know about the **Borrowers**, and read one of the books
  in my teens, but I disliked them; they seemed unreal, with no historical
  background, and it seemed odd that they lived this cosy family life more
  or less without any supporting 'civilisation'. The nomes are communal,
  and have to think in terms of nomekind. No. Any influence at all is from
  Swift, in this case."

  "I'll pass on whether Truckers is funnier than the Borrowers, but I'll
  defend them as being *more serious* than the Borrowers. It depends on how
  you define 'serious'."

- The American version of the Nome trilogy is not word-for-word the same as
  the original one.

  Terry says: "The Truckers trilogy has a fair amount of changes of a
  'pavement = sidewalk' nature which is understandable in a book which
  should be accessible to kids. They also excised the word 'damn' so's not
  to get banned in Alabama, which is a shame because I've always wanted to
  be banned in Alabama, ever since I first heard of the place."

- [p. 60/54] "iii. And the Mark of the Dragon was on it. iv. And the Mark
  was Jekub."

  'Jekub' was the Nomes' attempted pronunciation of JCB, the name of a
  well-known manufacturer of tractors, diggers, and the like, whose logo of
  course appears on all its products. Jekub, incidentally, appears to be a
  thing called a 'back-hoe loader'. In the American version of the Nomes
  trilogy 'JCB' was changed to 'CAT', standing for 'Caterpillar'.

- [p. 82/73] "'We shall fight them in the lane. We shall fight them at the
  gates. We shall fight them in the quarry. And we shall never surrender.'"

  Paraphrases one of Winston Churchill's famous WW II speeches. Possibly
  the easiest way to get to hear the original version is to listen to
  Supertramp's 'Fool's Overture'.

- [p. 142/126] "'Jcb? Jekub? It's got no vowels in it. What sort of name is
  that?'"

  This is a play on 'YHWH', the classical Hebrew spelling of Yahweh, i.e.
  Jehovah.


Wings
~~~~~

- [p. 135/121] "'The other humans around it are trying to explain to it
  what a planet is' 'Doesn't it know?' 'Many humans don't.
  Mistervicepresident is one of them.'"

  I don't think anybody in the Western world would not have caught this
  reference to Dan Quayle, but let's face it: in twenty years people will
  still be reading Terry Pratchett, and hopefully this APF – but who'll
  remember Misterexvicepresident?

- [p. 150/135] "The humans below tried shining coloured lights at it, and
  playing tunes at it, and eventually just speaking to it in every language
  known to humans."

  Refers to the climactic scene of Steven Spielberg's science fiction movie
  **Close Encounters of the Third Kind**, where contact with the aliens is
  indeed established by shining lights and playing tunes at their
  spaceship.


Only You Can Save Mankind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to fully appreciate this novel it may not be necessary, but I
think it will greatly add to your enjoyment and understanding, if you have
seen at least one of the **Alien** movies, and have played at least one
computer shoot-em-up arcade game.

- [p. 7/7] "The Mighty ScreeWee(TM) Empire(TM) is poised to attack Earth!"

  A wonderful parody of the way in which the typical computer action game
  is advertised or described on the box. Terry confirms:

  "Let's say I've played Wing Commander and Elite and X-Wing and loads of
  other games, so writing that first page was easy for me :-)"

- [p. 9/9] The Hero With A Thousand Extra Lives

  A reference to the title of Joseph Campbell's **The Hero with a Thousand
  Faces**, an anthropological work comparing and contrasting Hero myths from
  different cultures.

- [p. 13/13] "My dad brought me back 'Alabama Smith and the Jewels of Fate'
  from the States."

  Puns on the movie title **Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom**. Alabama
  and Indiana are both American states.

- [p. 19/19] "Hey, I really need a computer because that way I can play
  'Megasteroids'."

  'Asteroids' is the name of an ancient, very famous computer game.

- [p. 27/27] Johnny's nickname for his friend: 'MC Spanner', spoofs our
  world's pop-rap star 'MC Hammer' (a spanner is a wrench, and also
  (colloquially) equates as a mild insult to the American English 'dork').

- [p. 40/40] This is not really an annotation, because I think it is highly
  improbable that there is an actual link here, but the idea of Terry's
  'Cereal Killers' immediately reminded me of the short science fiction
  stories by Philip K. Dick. Not any particular one, but just the whole
  idea of something horrible masquerading as something ridiculously
  innocent appears again and again in Dick's slightly paranoid oeuvre.

  The serial/cereal pun itself is of course fairly obvious, and can be
  found in many other places, from old Infocom adventure games to Neil
  Gaiman's **Sandman** comics.

- [p. 42/42] "'I saw this film once, right, where there were these computer
  games and if you were really good the aliens came and got you and you had
  to fly a spaceship and fight a whole bad alien fleet,' said Bigmac."

  Bigmac is describing the 1984 science fiction movie **The Last
  Starfighter** here (starring Lance Guest and Robert Preston).

  As a movie this was decidedly a so-so experience (you can take my word
  for it, I have seen it), but it deserves credit for one major
  achievement: after the box-office disaster of **Tron** it was the first
  Hollywood film to make extensive use of computer-generated animation. And
  since **The Last Starfighter** was not a commercial failure, it effectively
  opened the road again for further use of computer graphics in movies.

- [p. 72/72] "But everyone watched **Cobbers**."

  'Cobber' is an Australian word meaning 'companion' or 'friend'; these
  days used more as an informal slang label for addressing someone (as in:
  "Now look here, cobber, ..."). Terry's use of this title reflects the
  fact that Australian soap operas (such as e.g. **Neighbours**) are
  extremely popular in the UK (as in the rest of Europe, I should add). As
  Terry explained:

  "Actually, the scene is probably lost on [non-Brits]; you have to
  understand that it is almost impossible to turn on a UK TV at any time
  between 4.30 – 6pm without hearing the distinctive sound of Australian
  adolescents locked in confrontation."

- [p. 109/109] "What's your game name?' 'Sigourney – *you're laughing!*'"

  Sigourney Weaver is the actress who plays the heroine in all three
  **Alien** movies.

- [p. 118/118] "On Earth, No-one Can Hear You Say 'Um'"

  The now famous slogan used in the advertising campaigns for the first
  **Alien** movie was: **In Space, No-one Can Hear You Scream**.

- [p. 133/133] "'I saw a film where there was an alien crawling around
  inside a spaceship's air ducts and it could come out wherever it liked,'
  said Johnny reproachfully. 'Doubtless it had a map,' said the Captain."

  The movie Johnny refers to is, of course, **Alien**.

- [p. 147/147] "'Is there anything I can do?' [...] 'I don't know,' she
  said. 'Is there *anything* you can do?'"

  The same dialogue occurs between Ripley and Sergeant Apone in the film
  **Aliens**.

- [p. 158/158] "'You're thinking: He'll be in there somewhere, hiding.'"

  In **Alien**, the alien creature eventually hid itself in the escape
  capsule Sigourney Weaver tried to get away in at the end.

- [p. 162/162] "'If we find a cat I'm going to kick it!'"

  In **Alien**, Sigourney goes *back* into the mother ship because she did
  not want to leave the cat behind.


Johnny And The Dead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 11/10] "'Singing "Here we go, here we go, here we go"?' said Johnny.
  'And "Viva a spanner"?'"

  For "here we go, here we go", see the annotation for p. 76/70 of "`Guards!
  Guards!`_".

  'Viva a spanner' is Johnny's version of the song 'Y Viva Espana', an
  early 70s hit which appeared at about the time that many Brits were first
  going on package tours to Spain (see also the annotation for p. 176/116
  of "`Good Omens`_").

- [p. 13/12] "'He said the Council sold it to some big company for
  fivepence because it was costing so much to keep it going.'"

  The right-wing Westminster council, headed by Lady Shirley Porter sold
  three cemeteries for 15p a couple of years ago, giving the same
  reasoning.

- [p. 20/19] "'No-one visits most of the graves now, except old Mrs
  Tachyon, and she's barmy.'"

  A tachyon is a hypothetical faster-than-light quantum particle, which has
  not been proven to actually exist.

- [p. 20/19] "'I was referring,' said his grandfather, 'to William
  Stickers.'"

  Refers to the posters forbidding flyposting reading "bill stickers will
  be prosecuted". These quickly attracted the graffito "Bill Stickers is
  Innocent" (and similar). William Stickers is obviously this much-harassed
  individual.

- [p. 24/22] "The last thing to go was the finger, still demonstrating its
  total disbelief in life after death."

  See the Cheshire Cat annotation for p. 142/141 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 26/25] "[...] a skinny kid with short hair and flat feet and asthma
  who had difficulty even *walking* in Doc Martens, [...]"

  Doc Martens (fully: 'Doctor Marten's patent Air-Wair boots and shoes',
  with 'The Original Doctor Marten's Air Cushion Sole. OIL FAT ACID PETROL
  ALKALI RESISTANT') are one of the most popular and fashionable footwear
  in Britain among the younger generation. Once associated with skin-heads
  and fascists they are now simply standard issue for almost anyone in the
  UK between the age of 16 and 30.

- [p. 28/26] "'I saw this film once, about a man with X-ray eyes,' said
  Bigmac."

  There are of course dozens of films that this description could apply to
  (starting with **Superman**, for instance), but the best candidate would
  appear to be the 1963 Roger Corman movie **X – The Man With X-Ray Eyes**,
  starring Ray Milland.

- [p. 29/27] "'After **Cobbers**,' said Bigmac."

  **Cobbers** is obviously modelled on the Australian soap opera **Neighbours**
  and its cousins.

- [p. 30/28] "[...] the new Council named it the Joshua Che N'Clement block
  [...]"

  A combination of Che Guevara, Joshua N'Komo, and the word 'inclement'.

- [p. 39/37] "Like Dead Man's Hand at parties."

  One of those party games known under a dozen different names, but which
  usually consists of people passing various items to each other behind
  their backs. The idea is to throw in some really weird stuff and gross
  people out through their imaginations.

- [p. 40/38] "'His head'll spin round in a minute!'"

  A reference to the 1973 horror movie **The Exorcist**, starring Linda
  Blair, which actually turned out to be a watchable movie, rather to my
  surprise. For a good laugh, I recommend instead that you try to get a
  hold of either its 1977 sequel **The Exorcist II**, or alternatively (if
  you like more intentional humour) of that one Saturday Night Live sketch
  with Richard Pryor ("the *bed* is *on* my *foot*!"). But I digress.

- [p. 42/39] "'The lady in the hat is Mrs Sylvia Liberty,' he whispered."

  Sylvia Pankhurst was a famous suffragette (in fact it was something of a
  family trade), but it was Emily Davidson who threw herself under the
  horse.

- [p. 43/41] "'I saw this film,' gabbled Wobbler, 'where these houses were
  built on an old graveyard and someone dug a swimming pool and all the
  skeletons came out and tried to strangle people –'"

  This movie is of course the famous 1982 movie **Poltergeist**.

- [p. 48/45] "'[...] the messages from God he heard when he played Cliff
  Richard records backwards –'"

  This may need some explaining for people who are (a) not into rock music
  or religious fundamentalism, and (b) not European and therefore not in
  the possession of the slightest idea as to who Cliff Richard is.

  To begin with, it is a particularly obnoxious popular myth that heavy
  metal groups (or any popular performer, for that matter) hide Satanic or
  suicide-inducing or otherwise demoralising messages in their songs. This
  is done by a technique known as 'backwards masking', which means the
  message can only be revealed by playing the music backwards (although the
  subliminal effect is supposedly in full effect when our innocent children
  listen to these songs the right way round).

  Needless to say, this is all an incredible load of nonsense: most
  supposedly Satanic messages exist only in people's fevered imaginations,
  and even if there *were* such messages there isn't a single shred of
  evidence as to their effectiveness.

  To finally arrive at the main idea behind this annotation: Cliff Richard
  is a perpetually youthful-looking, squeaky-clean British pop singer,
  who's been around since the sixties and is still hugely popular today,
  even though (or perhaps even more so because) he found religion in the
  seventies. Consequently, any backwards messages in *his* music, will most
  definitely not be Satanic, but rather the opposite.

- [p. 49/46] "Grandad was watching **Video Whoopsy**."

  Although obviously meant as an equivalent to shows like **America's
  Funniest Home Videos**, this is not the name of any existing show (the
  British version is called **You've Been Framed**). The word 'whoopsy' was
  popularised by the 70s UK sitcom **Some Mother's Do 'Ave 'Em** as a
  euphemism for excrement, as in "The cat's done a whoopsy on the carpet".

- [p. 58/54] "*WHEEEsssh* ... we built this city on ... *ssshshhh* [...]
  scaramouche, can you ... *shssssss* ..."

  The "we built this city" fragment is from the 1985 hit song 'We Built
  This City' by the group Starship, formerly Jefferson Starship, formerly
  the legendary Jefferson Airplane.

  The "scaramouche" line is, of course, from Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'
  (see also the annotation for p. 26/8 of "`Good Omens`_").

- [p. 66/61] "'Who *is* Shakespeare's Sister and why is she singing on the
  wireless?'"

  Shakespear's Sister is a female vocal duo (one of whom is a former
  Bananarama member, as well as the wife of Dave Stewart from 'Eurythmics'
  fame – but I digress), who were hugely popular in the UK in the early
  90s (and a bit less popular in the rest of the world, I'm afraid) with
  hits like 'Stay' and 'Hello (Turn Your Radio On)'. Shakespear's Sister
  have split up recently.

  British comediennes French and Saunders did a parody of Shakespear's
  Sister, called Dickens' Daughter, which has to be seen to be believed.

- [p. 68/63] "'You have to have three A-levels.'"

  See the annotation for p. 296/203 of "`Good Omens`_".

- [p. 72/67] "*The People's Shroud is Deepest Black*"

  As opposed to the People's Flag, which is Deepest Red, according to 'The
  Red Flag', which is indeed a "song of the downtrodden masses" (see p.
  86/79), as used by many socialist and communist parties.

- [p. 74/68] "'Ghosts don't phone up radio stations!' 'I saw this film once
  where they came out of the telephone,' said Bigmac, [...]"

  Refers to the 1986 movie **Poltergeist II**, starring JoBeth Williams and
  Craig T. Nelson.

- [p. 84/78] "'It's worse than that. I'm dead, Jim.'"

  Refers to the **Star Trek**-associated catch phrase: "It's worse than that,
  he's dead Jim."

  The phrase "He's dead, Jim" was a classic line from the television
  series, spoken by Dr McCoy to Captain Kirk, in at least five different
  episodes (if you must know: 'The Enemy Within' (about a dog), 'The
  Changeling' (about Scotty), 'Wolf in the Fold' (about Hengist), 'Spectre
  of the Gun' (about Chekov), and 'Is There in Truth no Beauty?' (about
  Marvick)), and there are numerous near-miss instances where he said
  something similar, such as "The man is dead, Jim" or "He's dead,
  Captain". (This information courtesy of the newsgroup
  rec.arts.startrek.misc.)

  The "It's worse than that" part of the quote did not originate with **Star
  Trek** itself, but with the 1987 song 'Star Trekkin', by The Firm, which
  was a huge novelty hit set to a simple 'London Bridge is falling down'
  tune, and featuring lyrics along the lines of:

    |   It's life Jim but not as we know it
    |   not as we know it, not as we know it
    |   It's life Jim but not as we know it
    |   Not as we know it Captain

    |   It's worse than that he's dead Jim
    |   Dead Jim, dead Jim
    |   It's worse than that he's dead Jim
    |   Dead Jim, dead!

- [p. 123/113] "'Wasn't there an Elm Street down by Beech Lane?' [...]
  'Freddie. Now that's a NICE name.'"

  Refers to the main character of the **Nightmare on Elm Street** series of
  horror movies.

- [p. 132/122] "[...] he'd never been able to remember all that 'Foxtrot
  Tango Piper' business [...]"

  Since 'Foxtrot Tango Piper' spells FTP, this *may* be a reference to the
  computer world's File Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol (and also
  the name for the associated types of client software) used to transfer
  files between different machines. FTP is a very important means of data
  exchange on the Internet (see e.g. the section on the Pratchett Archives
  in Chapter 6), and is also well-known for being rather confusing to the
  beginner. Cries along the lines of "I can't seem to get the hang of this
  FTP business" are often heard on the net.

  In the NATO spelling alphabet, the actual word used to denote the letter
  'p' is 'Papa', by the way.

- [p. 133/123] "'These aliens landed and replaced everyone in the town with
  giant vegetables.'"

  Refers to the 1978 movie **Invasion of the Body Snatchers**, starring
  Donald Sutherland. (Or perhaps to the original 1956 cult movie starring
  Kevin McCarthy.)

- [p. 140/129] "There is a night that never comes to an end..."

  The idea of racing the sun around the world is used in the opening pages
  of Larry Niven's novel **Ringworld**, in which Louis Wu spends 48 hours
  celebrating his 200th birthday by using matter transmitter booths to stay
  a step ahead of midnight.

  However, incredibly, Niven (who has a reputation for scientific accuracy
  – not 100% deserved, but still he's better than most SF authors on that
  score) originally had Wu going *west to east* to stay ahead of midnight.
  Even more incredibly, no one caught this mistake until after the book
  went on sale. It was corrected in the second printing. The first printing
  is, as you might guess, a very rare collector's item.

  Since we can be pretty certain Terry's read *Ringworld* (see "Strata_"),
  and since Niven's mistake is one of the most famous SF flubs of all time,
  Fletcher's admonition to Stanley Roundway ("We're going *west*, Stanley.
  For once in your death, try to get the directions right.") is probably no
  coincidence.

  On the other hand it should be noted that for some strange reason people
  on a.f.p. are always annoying Terry by trying to pin Larry Niven
  influences on him (see e.g. the annotation for p. 64/59 of "`Guards!
  Guards!`_"). Maybe this annotation, too, is just a far-fetched coincidence.
  It wouldn't be the first in this document, now would it?

- [p. 142/130] "'New York, New York.' 'Why did they name it twice?' 'Well,
  they ARE Americans.'"

  A reference to the 1979 hit song 'New York, New York', by Gerard Kenny,
  which starts out:

    |   New York, New York,
    |   So good they named it twice.
    |   New York, New York
    |   All the scandal and the vice
    |   I love it
    |   New York, New York
    |   Now isn't it a pity
    |   What they say about New York City

  See also the annotation for p. 72/65 of "`Reaper Man`_".

- [p. 148/136] "In a neglected corner, Mrs Tachyon was industriously
  Vim-ing a gravestone."

  Apparently, Vim is unknown in the USA, but in Europe it is well-known as
  *the* scouring powder for cleaning sinks and stuff. It is quite ancient,
  and has lately been eclipsed a bit by more modern (and less destructive)
  cleaners such as Jif or Mr Sheen.

- [p. 158/146] "'Met Hannibal Lecter in a dark alley, did it?' said
  Yo-less."

  A reference to the cannibalistic, eh, hero of the 1991 movie **The Silence
  of the Lambs**.

- [p. 159/147] "'Baron Samedi, the voodoo god,' said Yo-Less. 'I got the
  idea out of James Bond.'"

  The James Bond movie Yo-less means is **Live and Let Die**.

- [p. 164/151] "'Body snatchers!' said Wobbler. 'Burke 'n Head!' said
  Bigmac."

  Burke and Hare were a famous pair of 'resurrectionists' who operated in
  Edinburgh in the 19th century. Basically, they dug up fresh bodies from
  graveyards, in order to supply surgeons with material for anatomical
  dissections. Edinburgh University is not very proud of its association
  with this trade, especially since eventually, when demand outstripped
  supply, so to speak, Burke and Hare went a bit overboard and started
  creating their own supply of fresh, dead bodies.

  Also, Birkenhead is a town in Merseyside (the Liverpool area).

- [p. 171/158] "'Good Work, Fumbling Four! And They All Went Home For Tea
  And Cakes.'"

  There was a series of children's books by Enid Blyton starring the Famous
  Five who managed to repeatedly avert crimes, capture gangs and generally
  have a Jolly Good Time.


Johnny And The Bomb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ [p. 16] "'Like in that film where the robot is sent back to kill the
  mother of the boy who's going to beat the robots when he grows up.'"

  A reference to the original 1984 **The Terminator** movie.

+ [p. 40] "'Millennium hand and shrimp?'"

  Ah, clearly Mrs Tachyon is somehow receiving on the same astral frequency
  as the Bursar and Foul Ole Ron. See also the annotation for p. 324/233 of
  "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 50] "'[...] the mysterious rain of fish we had in September [...]'"

  A Fortean resonance (see also the annotation for p. 155/99 of "`Good
  Omens`_".

+ [p. 64] "*The Truth is Out Of Here*"

  Puns on the famous tagline for the **The X-Files** television series (see
  also the annotation for p. 154 of "Hogfather_").

+ [p. 67] "D'you see that film where the car travelled in time [...]'"

  Undoubtedly this is the original **Back To The Future** movie.

+ [p. 73] "'Me, and four token boys. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. It's only a mercy
  we haven't got a dog.'"

  A reference to the Famous Five. See also the annotation for p. 127/80 of
  "`Good Omens`_" and the annotation for p. 87 of "`The Amazing Maurice and his
  Educated Rodents`_".

+ [p. 203] "She held up a pickled onion."

  It was observed on afp that the previous Johnny books both seem to leave
  open the option that what happens is all somehow a dream or a figment of
  Johnny's imagination, and that Kirsty actually finding a physical object
  this time would be an indication of a change in focus. But Terry
  disagrees:

  "In OYCSM Kirsty ('Sigourney') is involved and remembers it, and Wobbler
  gets messages from Johnny on his own computer screen. OYCSM is, I admit,
  deliberately the most 'equivocal' of the trio. I think it's not an
  either/or case – it's all real AND it's all happening in his
  imagination.

  In JatD newspapers float in the air, the Dead are heard to speak on the
  radio (and the guys in the radio station notice this) and things happen
  in the pub and the cinema.

  In JatB bits of the town change, Mrs Tachyon has fresh fish and chips
  wrapped in a 1941 newspaper and is seen by people in the past after being
  in the present, the gang appear mysteriously in front of the old folks'
  club, Johnny (I think) finds that there's someone in the old newspaper
  picture which (if you know it's Wobbler) looks like Wobbler, and Johnny
  also has the playing card missing from his grandad's pack (and grandad
  got a medal for running a distance which couldn't possibly be run in the
  time). But what happens is the familiar 'history reasserting itself'
  motif, as in **Back to the Future III** – there have to be *clues* that
  the process misses, of course, otherwise there'd be no point. Remember
  that (in addition to all the other stuff) it's not the pickle that's the
  clue, it's the fact that Kirsty now *remembers*."

  When subsequently someone on afp said that they'd always figured the
  Johnny books were explorations of childhood angst in which the
  protagonist's fantasies are projected onto reality in an attempt to
  escape to a different world where he can be more powerful and
  significant, Terry replied in no uncertain terms:

  "I can't be having with that pernicious rubbish. 'Window' books, they are
  called: young Sid has big problems at home, so in his dreams he battles a
  dragon, and this gives him the strength to deal with the problems – as
  if imagination and fantasy were some kind of medicines. Yo-less trots out
  this handy explanation in OYCSM.

  I'd be the first to say that the exercise of imagination and humanity's
  genius with metaphor can make a huge difference to our lives and are part
  of what makes us human. I just hate to see fantasy dismissed as a kind of
  poultice or, worse, as a drug. It's led to some godawful smug books (and
  some very good ones, I have to admit – but a lot of dumb ones too).

  There *are* natural explanations for a lot of the things that happen in
  the books, if you are desperate to find them (and people will sometimes
  go through some serious mental gymnastics to avoid changing their
  preconceived ideas about the universe) But I like to be equivocal about
  what is 'real' and what isn't – to Johnny it's all real, and that's what
  counts. 'Saving the Screewee' isn't some code for improving his own life
  – he deals with all the problems on their own terms and half the time
  he's projecting reality onto fantasy. Maybe sorting out one part of your
  life gives you some strength to sort out others, but you don't need
  aliens in your computer to tell you that.

  So: is what happens in the books real? Yes. Does it all happen in
  Johnny's head? Yes. Are the Dead a metaphor? Yes. Are they real? Yes. Not
  just waving, but particalling."


The Carpet People
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 120/110] "'For me, all possibilities are real. I live them all. [...]
  Otherwise they never could have happened.'"

  Another one of Terry's quantum references. What Culaina describes here is
  a particular interpretation of quantum theory, namely that each quantum
  event causes time to split up into distinct possibilities ("the trousers
  of time"). The idea that certain events can only happen if they are
  directly observed is one of the best-known concepts in quantum mechanics.


The Unadulterated Cat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 7] "The Campaign for Real Cats is against fizzy keg cats."

  Parodies the aims and objectives of the Campaign for Real Ale, a British
  organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of traditional
  beer-making in the face of the threat from mass-produced
  'love-in-a-canoe' fizzy keg beer foisted on an unsuspecting public by the
  large national breweries.

- [p. 18] "[...] good home in this case means anyone who doesn't actually
  arrive in a van marked J. Torquemada and Sons, Furriers."

  See the annotation for p. 137/88 of "`Good Omens`_" if you don't know who
  Torquemada was.

- [p. 28] "Or perhaps there is now a Lorry cat undreamed of by T. S.
  Eliot."

  T. S. Eliot, 20th century poet and critic. He wrote the book **Old
  Possum's Book of Practical Cats**, which the musical **Cats** was based on.

- [p. 28] "[...] growing fat on Yorkie bars."

  See the annotation for p. 130/119 of "Truckers_".

- [p. 35] "You need a word with a cutting edge. *Zut!* is pretty good."

  'Zut' is also a French exclamation, meaning "Damn" or "drop dead".

- [p. 44] "[...] sitting proudly beside a miniature rodent Somme on the
  doorstep."

  The Somme is a river in the north of France, which has been the scene of
  some extremely heavy fighting in both World Wars. In 1916 for instance, a
  French/British offensive pushed back the German lines there, at very
  heavy cost to both sides.

- [p. 73] "It's bluetits and milk-bottle tops all over again, I tell you."

  Refers to a well-known evolution-in-action anecdote concerning a
  particular species of birds which collectively, over a period of time,
  learned how to open milk-bottles that the milkman left on the doorsteps
  each morning in a certain English rural area.

- [p. 84] "[...] the price of celery is eternal vigilance."

  This paraphrases "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance", nowadays
  usually associated with Kennedy. It was in fact first said by John
  Philpot Curran in his "The Right of Election of the Lord Mayor of Dublin"
  speech in 1790.

- [p. 86] "a garden that looks like an MoD installation,"

  MoD = Ministry of Defence.

- [p. 92] "Owing to an unexplained occurrence of Lamarckian heredity [...]"

  Lamarck was a contemporary of Darwin who became the symbol for what was
  for a long time a very strong rival of Darwin's own natural selection as
  an explanation for the mechanism of evolution. According to Lamarckism
  (simplification alert!), changes acquired by an individual of a species
  can immediately be inherited by the next generation, thus accounting for
  evolution. Lamarckism has by now completely disappeared as a serious
  evolutionary theory, in favour of modified versions of natural selection.

Thoughts and Themes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Turtle Moves!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was already mentioned in one of the annotations: on alt.fan.pratchett
there will at any given moment in time be at least one discussion ongoing
about some aspect of the Discworld considered as a physical object. What
does it look like? Where did it come from? Does it rotate? What do
constellations look like for the people living on it? Where are the
continents located? Is there a map of Ankh-Morpork <<There is now>>? What
are the names of the Elephants <<Berilia, Tubul, Great T'Phon and Jerakeen,
just in case anyone'd forgotten>>? Is Great A'Tuin male or female? That
sort of thing.

Summarising these discussions is useless: nobody ever agrees on anything,
anyway, and besides: half the fun is in the discussion itself – who cares
if these issues ever get properly 'resolved'. Nevertheless, I think it will
be in the spirit of this annotation file, and of interest to the readers,
if I reproduce here some of the things Terry Pratchett *himself* has said
on the various subjects, at those times when he chose to enter the
discussion.

To start with some history: many people think the appearance of the
Discworld as described in the novels was an invention of Terry's. This is
not really the case: in Hindu mythology, for instance, we find the idea of
a lotus flower growing out of Vishnu's navel. Swimming in a pool in the
lotus flower is the world turtle, on whose back stand four elephants facing
in the four compass directions. On their backs is balanced the flat,
disc-shaped world. See also Josh Kirby's magnificent drawing of the
Discworld in the illustrated version of "Eric_".

  Terry: "The myth that the world is flat and goes through space on the
  back of a turtle is, with variations, found on every continent. An
  African fan has just sent me a Bantu legend, which however does not
  include the character of N'Rincewind."

Next up are the various questions concerning (a) exactly how the Discworld
looks, and (b) how it interacts with other celestial objects. Some relevant
quotes from Terry (as before, quotation marks (" ") indicate the beginning
and ending of quotes from different Usenet articles):

  "The elephants face outwards. The spinning of the Disc does not harm the
  elephants because that's how the universe is arranged."

  "I've got some drawings I did of the Discworld at the start and I've
  always thought of it like this:

  The *shell* of the turtle is slightly smaller than the world, but the
  flippers and head and tail are all visible from the Rim, looking down –
  as Rincewind does in "`The Colour of Magic`_"."

  "The Discworld revolves. The sun and moon orbit it as well. This enables
  the Disc to have seasons. And the DW 'universe' – turtle, world, sun,
  moon – moves slowly through our own universe."

  "Where is the sun at noon? There are two answers.

        A) It's directly over the centre of the Disc;
        B) It's in a small cafe."

On the subject of constellations and what they would look like (see also
the file discworld-constellations available from the Pratchett Archives):

  "GA must move fairly fast – in "`The Light Fantastic`_" a star goes from a
  point to a sun (I assume GA halted somewhere in the temperate orbits) in
  a few weeks. I've always thought that Discworld astrology would largely
  consist of research; we already know the character traits, what we're
  trying to find is *what the new constellations are*, as the turtle moves.
  And of course some particular constellations might have very distinct and
  peculiar characteristics that are never repeated. Some constellations,
  facing in front and behind, would change very little. The ones 'to the
  side' would change a lot. Bear in mind also that the sun revolves around
  the disc and the disc revolves slowly, so that every group of stars in
  the sky would have a chance to be a constellation for birth date
  purposes. In short, we need hundreds and hundreds of constellation names
  – good job there's Usenet, eh?"

Finally, on the less cosmic subject of planetary maps (for more information
about the Innovations comics and the Clarecraft models mentioned below,
read the alt.fan.pratchett Frequently Asked Questions files, available from
the Pratchett Archives):

  "The map of the Discworld in the Innovations comic is just an artist's
  squiggle. The surface of the Discworld in the Clarecraft model is...
  er... rather amazingly close to my idea, although the vertical dimension
  is hugely exaggerated. And Stephen Briggs, having just sent off the
  'definitive' map of Ankh-Morpork, has said that he can deduce a map of
  the Disc. Fans have also sent me fairly accurate maps. Once you work out
  that the Circle Sea is rather similar to the Med, but with Ephebe and
  Tsort and Omnia and Djelibeybi (and Hersheba, one of these days) all on
  the 'north African' coast, Klatch being 'vaguely Arabic' and Howondaland
  being 'vaguely African' it's easy.

  But all maps are valid."

  "I've never thought that any parts of Discworld corresponded exactly to
  places on Earth. Lancre is 'generic Western Europe/US rural', for example
  – not the Ozarks, not the North of England, but maybe with something of
  each.

  The Sto Plains are 'vaguely Central European'; Klatch, Ephebe, Tsort,
  etc, are all 'vaguely Southern European/North African'.

  Genua was designed to be a 'Magic Kingdom' but in a New Orleans setting
  – I hope the voodoo, cooking etc. made that reasonably obvious. Genua
  and the other countries mentioned in "`Witches Abroad`_" are all on the
  other side of the Ramtops, which more or less bisect the continent.

  As far as the Ankh-Morpork map is concerned, we've decided to get it
  right *at a point in time*. In any case, it's a developing city; the city
  of "`Guards! Guards!`_" has evolved some way from the one in "`The Colour of
  Magic`_"."


Song...
~~~~~~~

The one song that all Discworld fans will be familiar with, is of course
Nanny Ogg's favourite ballad: 'The Hedgehog Can Never Be Buggered At All'
(see also the annotation for p. 36/35 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_").

I will start this section with the complete text to the song that might
have been the prototype for the hedgehog-song – except that it wasn't. It
can be found in Michael Green's book **Why Was He Born So Beautiful and
Other Rugby Songs** (1967, Sphere UK), it is called 'The Sexual Life of the
Camel', it probably dates back to the 1920s/30s, and it goes:

    |   The carnal desires of the camel
    |   Are stranger than anyone thinks,
    |   For this passionate but perverted mammal
    |   has designs on the hole of the Sphinx,
    |   But this deep and alluring depression
    |   Is oft clogged by the sands of the Nile,
    |   Which accounts for the camel's expression
    |   And the Sphinx's inscrutable smile.

    |   In the process of Syphilization
    |   From the anthropoid ape down to man
    |   It is generally held that the Navy
    |   Has buggered whatever it can.
    |   Yet recent extensive researches
    |   By Darwin and Huxley and Ball
    |   Conclusively prove that the hedgehog
    |   Has never been buggered at all.

    |   And further researches at Oxford
    |   Have incontrovertibly shown
    |   That comparative safety on shipboard
    |   Is enjoyed by the hedgehog alone.
    |   But, why haven't they done it at Spithead,
    |   As they've done it at Harvard and Yale
    |   And also at Oxford and Cambridge
    |   By shaving the spines off its tail!

The annoying thing about the hedgehog song is of course that Terry only
leaks us bits and pieces of it, but certainly never enough material to
deduce a complete text from. So alt.fan.pratchett readers decided to write
their *own* version of the song, which is available for downloading from
the Pratchett Archives.

The first version of the song was written and posted by Matthew Crosby (who
tried to incorporate all the lines mentioned in the Discworld novels),
after which the text was streamlined and many verses were added by other
readers of the newsgroup. Currently we have thirteen verses, which makes
the song a bit too long to include here in its entirety.

Nevertheless, I thought it would be fun to show what we've come up with, so
I have compromised and chosen to reproduce just my own favourite verses:

    |   Bestiality sure is a fun thing to do
    |   But I have to say this as a warning to you:
    |   With almost all animals, you can have ball
    |   But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    |   *CHORUS:*
    |   The spines on his back are too sharp for a man
    |   They'll give you a pain in the worst place they can
    |   The result I think you'll find will appall:
    |   The hedgehog can never be buggered at all!

    |   Mounting a horse can often be fun
    |   An elephant too; though he weighs half a ton
    |   Even a mouse (though his hole is quite small)
    |   But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    |   A fish is refreshing, although a bit wet
    |   And a cat or a dog can be more than a pet
    |   Even a giraffe (despite being so tall)
    |   But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    |   You can ravish a sloth but it would take all night
    |   With a shark it is faster, but the darned beast might bite
    |   We already mentioned the horse, you may recall
    |   But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    |   For prosimian fun, you can bugger a lemur
    |   To bolster your name as a pervert and schemer
    |   The lemurs cry *Frink!* as a coy mating call
    |   But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

Finally, we come to the old drinking song mentioned in the annotation for p.
99/82 of "`Eric`_": 'The Ball of Kerrymuir'. This song can, coincidentally
enough, also be found in Michael Green's **Why Was He Born So Beautiful and
Other Rugby Songs**. That version appears to have the dirty words replaced
by rows of asterisks – a rather useless form of editorial restraint, since
in this particular case it means the song now contains more asterisks than
normal alphabetic characters. Enter alt.fan.pratchett correspondent Tony
D'Arcy, who was kind enough to fax me an uncensored copy of the song. 'The
Ball of Kerrymuir' has 43 verses, a small subset of which I now reproduce
for your reading pleasure, just to give you a feel for the song. From here
on down this section of the APF is rated X.

    |   Oh the Ball, the Ball of Kerrymuir,
    |   Where your wife and my wife,
    |   Were a-doing on the floor.

    |   *CHORUS:*
    |   Balls to your partner,
    |   Arse against the wall.
    |   If you never get fucked on a Saturday night
    |   You'll never be fucked at all.

    |   There was fucking in the kitchen
    |   And fucking in the halls
    |   You couldn't hear the music for
    |   The clanging of the balls.

    |   Now Farmer Giles was there,
    |   His sickle in his hand,
    |   And every time he swung around
    |   He circumcised the band.

    |   Jock McVenning he was there
    |   A-looking for a fuck,
    |   But every cunt was occupied
    |   And he was out of luck.

    |   The village doctor he was there
    |   He had his bag of tricks,
    |   And in between the dances,
    |   He was sterilising pricks.

    |   And when the ball was over,
    |   Everyone confessed:
    |   They all enjoyed the dancing,
    |   but the fucking was the best.


...and Dance
~~~~~~~~~~~~

when you mention 'Discworld' and 'dance' in the same breath, you can only
be talking about one thing: Morris Dancing, a subject that most non-Brits
will be almost completely in the dark about. Brewer has this to say on the
subject:

**Morris Dance**: brought to England in the reign of Edward III, when John of
Gaunt returned from Spain. In the dance, bells were jingled, and staves or
swords clashed. It was a military dance of the Moors or Moriscos, in which
five men and a boy engaged; the boy wore a 'morione' or head-piece, and was
called **Mad Morion**.

Which is interesting, but doesn't really explain anything in a 20th century
context. Luckily, a newsgroup like alt.fan.pratchett attracts contemporary
Morris Dancers like flies, and for the rest of this section I will give the
floor to Rich Holmes:

"In a number of books (including "Strata_", "`Guards! Guards!`_", "`Reaper Man`_",
and "`Lords and Ladies`_") Pratchett refers to morris dancing. These allusions
may be lost on the typical American reader. Picture, then, six men in white
shirts and trousers, decorated with ribbons, wearing bells on their legs,
in a two-by-three formation – the men, not the bells. To a tune played on
fiddle or squeezebox, they dance up and down, back and forth, gesturing
with big white handkerchiefs in their hands – or, maybe, clashing
yard-long willow sticks with one another. That's morris dancing, or at
least the species of morris dancing that was done in the late 19th century
in the Cotswolds region of England.

It's also done today, throughout the English-speaking world (though in
America it's not exactly an everyday sight), these days by women's teams
and mixed teams as well as by men. There are several hundred morris teams
in England as well as 170 or so in the US and Canada and God knows how many
in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and other odd places.

As for where it came from, and when, and what it all means, no one really
knows. Some of its roots seem to go back to the European continent sometime
in or before the 15th century. Similar, possibly related dances were and
are found in Europe and even as far away as India. For a while in the late
19th and early 20th centuries they were commonly claimed by folklorists to
be a remnant of a pre-Christian fertility rite performed by a male
priesthood; there's really no hard evidence to support such a theory,
though.

Terry Pratchett tells us he's "never waved a hankie in anger" nor knows any
morris dancers personally, but that he finds the morris dance kind of
fascinating.

Those interested can contact either Tom Keays (htkeys@syr.edu) or Rich
Holmes (rsholmes@suhep.phy.syr.edu) about the Morris Dancing Discussion
List. You knew there was an ulterior motive here, didn't you?"

There is also a web page for the Morris Dancing Discussion List. The URL
is: <http://web.syr.edu/~hytelnet/mddl/>.


Reverse Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the Discworld canon growing and reaching an increasingly wider
audience around the globe, we are starting to see something I'm calling
'reverse referencing': *other* writers who put references to the Discworld
into their books.

The examples I have had reported to me so far:

- **Due South**

  The most often remarked-upon reverse annotation of the past year or so
  concerns the television series **Due South**, which is about the adventures
  of a Canadian Mountie (Constable Benton Fraser), stationed in Chicago.

  The similarities between Benton Fraser and Carrot are, especially in the
  first few episodes, indeed remarkable. Like Carrot, Benton is innocent
  and straight-forward to the point of being naive (but not stupid!). He is
  nigh-on superhuman, polite, memorises everybody's name, works alongside
  cynical and jaded cops, and the first things he does are (1) take
  lodgings in the roughest neighbourhood around and (2) walk into a lowlife
  bar in full Mountie uniform shouting "Excuse me...". And as with Carrot,
  his faith in human nature is almost always rewarded.

  I doubt very much whether Benton Fraser is *really* based on Carrot
  (after all, the archetype that both characters are based on goes back a
  long way), but sometimes I wonder: Fraser's faithful companion is a wolf,
  and in one episode of **Due South** Fraser and his partner are locked in a
  meat storage room and nearly freeze to death...

- Computer Games.

  References to the Discworld have occasionally been cropping up in
  otherwise unrelated computer games. In **Angband**, for instance, one of
  the owners of the general store is 'Rincewind the Chicken'. In the
  legendary game **Nethack** you can explore the Dungeons as a tourist,
  starting out your quest with lots of gold and food, a credit card, and an
  expensive camera. Although the tourist character class wasn't originally
  created as a Discworld reference, there have been many Discworld-inspired
  additions in later releases of the game: the tourist's patron gods are
  now The Lady, Blind Io, and Offler, while Twoflower himself appears on
  the special quest level. And if you're hallucinatory, you may get to see
  the Luggage.

- **Dream Park: The Californian Voodoo Game**, by Larry Niven and Stephen
  Barnes, 1991.

  The UK edition of this book describes the character Alan Myers as "a
  Terry Pratchett wizard". In the U.S. edition this sentence was simply
  left out.

  At a later point in the novel (both editions this time), two characters
  exchange the following lines:

      – It's been, what – five years?
      – Since the Diskworld Game. Ah... Hamburg.

  Note the misspelling of Discworld.

- **Object-Oriented Languages, Systems and Applications**, by Blair,
  Hutchinson, Gallagher and Shepherd, 1991.

  "Consider the domain of Colours. If we have Red, Green and Blue, but now
  widen the domain to include Octaroon, an old program may read an unknown
  value from a new instance. Conversely, if we begin with Octaroon
  included, but now decide we no longer believe in Magic and remove it thus
  narrowing the domain, [...]"

  Again, note the misspelling, this time of 'Octarine'. Since this is a
  formal text book, "`The Colour of Magic`_" gets a proper mention in the
  references.

- The **British Medical Journal**, January 1996 edition.

  The BMJ has a 'Soundings' page, where doctors get a chance to write about
  a subject of their choice. In this issue, Liam Farrell, a GP from
  Crossmaglen, ended his column with the line:

  "This is only common sense, but, as we have said before, in academic
  general practice, common sense is as rare as a tourist in Ankh-Morpork."

- **The Books of Magic**, by John Ney Rieber, issue #13, April 1995.

  Tim and Molly on their way through Soho, London, pass a movie theatre.
  The Billboard says: "PRATCHETT THEATRE – now playing: Unseen Demo..."
  (the rest is cut off).

- **The Books of Magic II**, by Neil Gaiman and Scott Hampton, 1990.

  Tim is told of an occult battle taking place offstage in Calcutta: "You
  wouldn't believe it. The cult of Kali, three Ninja death squads, the
  Brotherhood of the Cold Flame, a thousand elephants..."

- **Dirty Work**, by Dan McGirt, 1993, Pan Books, ISBN 0 330 32391 1, p. 215.

  The relevant quotation is:

  "I peeled off my outer clothing and removed the Cosmosuit. Dreadguards
  took it away from me and placed it, along with Gardion and Overwhelm, in
  a wooden chest. They also took the Rae medallion and the Ring of Raxx.
  'The chest is made of insipid wormwood, the most highly inanimate and
  unmagical substance known to the world, which specifically does not run
  around on hundreds of tiny legs nor eat people,' Dread said of the box.
  'But it does prevent you from summoning your magic sword by thought.'
  'Thought of everything haven't you?'"

  Readers on a.f.p. are, by the way, unanimously unenthusiastic about this
  book, so don't assume that just because it mentions the Luggage it's got
  to be a good read.


Words From The Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are a number of excerpts from articles by Terry Pratchett that I think
fall under the heading of 'annotations' but which are either not associated
with one particular novel, or else so long they would break the flow of the
regular annotations.

Quotation marks (" ") indicate the beginning and ending of quotes from
different Usenet articles. For further clarity I am putting my own
editorial text in square brackets ([ ]) for the rest of this section.

- What are the 'rules' and 'regulations' of headology? It just seems to be
  an area that is not properly defined.

  "Ah. It appears you have discovered Rule 1."

- Should Terry write Discworld novels with new characters, or should he
  write Discworld novels with established characters. Should he, in fact,
  listen to what his readers have to say on this subject?

  "1. I always listen to advice. It's polite.

  2. If I *heeded* all the advice I've had over the years, I'd have written
  18 books about Rincewind. Absolutely true. The most common plea in my
  mail right now is 'when are we going to read about Rincewind in XXXX?'
  I'm being instructed that I have a duty to my readers – if I was
  innocent, I'd be attaching corks to that battered pointy hat even now.
  But perhaps this is an issue on which I have thought long and hard. After
  all, it's my living and ten years of my life.

  If Discworld continues, then old characters will continue – Rincewind
  will get red dust in his sandals, the Watch will be back, Gaspode will
  probably limp into stories. And new characters will arise. Why not? It's
  not as if there are *rules*. What will probably *end* Discworld is simple
  crowding – the Watch already make Ankh-Morpork based stories a little
  problematical, and I won't get into the comic book convention of having
  Captain Courage out of town so that Commander Socko can take centre
  stage."

  "My publishers have *never* insisted that I 'write another Discworld
  book'. If I rang them up and said 'the next one's a Western' (or
  whatever) they'd probably say 'Oh, right.' In fact the current contract
  does NOT specify that my next book, for example, must be Discworld.

  Of course I listen to my readers! So the next book will be:

  Set in Ankh-Morpork/not set in Ankh-Morpork. With lots of the good old
  characters/with a whole cast of new characters. Written like the old
  books, which were better/written like the later books, which were better.
  With lots of character development/none of that dull character
  development stuff, which gets in the way of the jokes. Short/long.

  You want fries with that?"

- About the Discworld CD-ROM Game, and its sequel.

  "*What I did on the Computer Game*
  by Terry Pratchett

  I:

  a) rewrote and tinkered and generally worked quite hard on the script,
  although the guy that drafted it was pretty good;

  b) approved (and sometimes didn't approve) the characters – I think the
  game's got the third version of Rincewind and of the Librarian, for
  example.

  I think some of the puzzles are a shade too obtuse, and when Discworld II
  is done I'll probably get more involved in them. But the look and feel of
  the game is pretty close to the early Rincewind books, I think. As game
  adaptations go, I was about as closely involved as possible for someone
  who doesn't write code. It seemed to us all that 'Shouting at people' was
  a fairly realistic statement of the position."

- About Unseen University's financial status.

  "Unseen University owns quite a lot of land in the area of Sator Square
  and while the rents are pretty low there are a lot of properties. There
  have been various bequests by former Archchancellors and so on over the
  history of the university. I suspect UU also earns money for generalised
  magical services in the city (the Pork Futures warehouse, for example).
  Over the millennia, it all adds up.

  Finally, UU expenses are not high. As far as I can tell, the senior
  wizards don't draw salaries but are paid in big dinners. Merchants in the
  city tend to 'give' UU foodstuffs because, well, wouldn't you prefer the
  local wizards to be fat and happy rather than thin and grouchy?"

- Are there any plans for Pterry to appear on Europe-wide TV?

  "I don't know. I hope not."

- On interviews.

  "People...(including everyone who interviews me for their Uni magazine,
  'cos I must have done a hundred of those things) Rule I of interviews
  should be:

  Write a list of your main questions to fix things in your mind; Throw it
  away; Start the interview; Then LISTEN to what the guy is saying so that
  you can follow any interesting thread; Because if you don't, then what
  you'll get is a quiz, not an interview.

  Sigh... It happens to me all the time:

  Q Where did you get the idea for the Discworld?

  A I stole it from an old man I met and now I've decided to tell you all.

  Q Who is your favourite character?

  Sigh..."

- Does Terry keep earlier drafts of his novels around?

  "I save about twenty drafts – that's ten meg of disc space – and the
  last one contains all the final alterations. Once it has been printed out
  and received by the publishers, there's a cry here of 'Tough shit,
  literary researchers of the future, try getting a proper job!' and the
  rest are wiped."

- On answering letters.

  [ Terry's wife Lyn reads all his mail first, and selects the reply order ]

  "It tends to arrive on my desk in this order:

      * Stuff that really needs to be dealt with today.
      * Stuff that needs an answer quickly.
      * Fan mail with SAEs (Lyn encourages politeness) or which is
        particularly interesting, worthy, funny or whatever.
      * Any other mail from *abroad* (because it's usually taken a while to
        get here).
      * Other mail.
      * People who send me their MS without checking first, and others of
        that kidney.

  However, I tend to stir it all up and in fact answer in the order:

      * From kids
      * Typed
      * Readable
      * Interesting
      * Others
      * Ones written in green ink on mauve paper
      * Ones with more exclamation marks that sanity dictates

  It's a strange fact, isn't it, that emails of all sorts tend to get
  answered within 24 hours while 'real' mail takes days or weeks or
  months."

- On the quality of Tolkien's writing.

  "What *is* a master writer?

  I read Tolkien now and notice the gaps, the evasions, all the 'bad'
  things... but few books have had the effect on me that TLOTR had when I
  was thirteen. Is he better or worse, for example, than Anita Brookner,
  widely regarded as a 'fine writer' although terribly dull to read? What
  is a writer supposed to *achieve*?

  Before I rank Tolkien, I'd like to know how the scoring is being done."

- Why Terry switched his German publishers (from Heyne to Goldmann).

  "There were a number of reasons for switching to Goldmann, but a deeply
  personal one for me was the way Heyne (in "Sourcery_", I think, although
  it may have been in other books) inserted a soup advert *in the text* ...
  a few black lines and then something like 'Around about now our heroes
  must be pretty hungry and what better than a nourishing bowl'... etc,
  etc.

  My editor was pretty sick about it, but the company wouldn't promise not
  to do it again, so that made it very easy to leave them. They did it to
  Iain Banks, too, and apparently at a con he tore out the offending page
  and ate it. Without croutons."

  [ A scan of the offending page is available from the Pratchett Archives. ]

- On people wanting to write their own Discworld stories.

  "There is no question that using characters, backgrounds, plot threads,
  etc, etc of an author in copyright *can* get you into serious legal
  trouble – there have been cases over this recently in the States. Try
  publishing a James Bond novel without consulting the Fleming estate and
  see what happens. It's amazing that people don't realise this. Publishers
  are used to getting stories with a covering note saying 'Here's a story
  I've set in Harry Spiven's 'World of Hurts' universe...' and the
  publishers say 'Did you get his permission?' and the writer says 'I don't
  have to do that, do I?' and the publishers go white and say 'Does the
  Pope shit in the woods?'

  That's the REAL world. Now let's talk about FANDOM.

  The law isn't any different. But there's people out there writing HHGTTG
  stuff, Red Dwarf stuff, Star Trek stuff and Discworld stuff for the
  amusement of their friends. Authors react on an individual basis. Some
  hate it and try to stop it. Anne McCaffrey – I think, although I'm open
  to correction here – doesn't mind so long as her main characters are not
  used. Douglas Adams seems to have tolerated/given permission for a welter
  of Hitchhikers stuff in the ZZ9 fanzine.

  It seems to me that if something is being done on an amateur basis by a
  fan for fans, and is clearly their own work, and is done out of a shared
  regard for the basic subject matter, then it would be kind of chilly for
  an author to run around hammering people. It's fandom, for god's sake. I
  don't give anyone *permission*, I just smile and think what the hell.

  There's a danger, of course, that some dumb bugger out there will
  interpret this as an indication that Discworld is now in the public
  domain or open to franchising. It is neither. If anyone tries a
  commercial rip-off – not a parody, not fanac, but a cynical attempt to
  cash in on my Discworld – then the sewage farm will hit the three
  megawatt aerogenerator."

  "I'd rather fanfic went on somewhere where I don't see it. Why? Because
  if A Fan writes a piece about, say, Discworld tax collectors, and I chose
  to write about Discworld tax collectors a year later, A Fan will send me
  the 'nyer, ripoff, you nicked my idea' email."

- What is the 'H.P. Lovecraft Holiday Fun Club'?

  "Nothing serious, really. This was just the name I gave to a group of
  people that seemed to turn up at every UK convention in the late 80s –
  me, Neil Gaiman, Jo Fletcher, Mary Gentle, Mike Harrison, etc, etc... As
  to why... well, it just seemed to fit in that well-known group of clubs
  like the Saudi Arabian Beer-Mat Collectors Association and the Venetian
  League of Joggers."

- About special deluxe editions of the Discworld novels.

  "We have been talking about some special Discworld editions, maybe with a
  few choice interior illustrations and some heavy leather covers. I
  personally would like to see them with chains, too.

  The snag for me is that the publishers keep talking about 'limited'
  editions. I've got a psychological objection to 'limited' editions. I
  like unlimited editions."

- On the lack of chapters in the Discworld novels.

  "DW books don't have chapters because, well, I just never got into the
  habit of chapters. I'm not sure why they should exist (except maybe in
  children's books, to allow the parent to say "I'll read to the end of the
  chapter and then you must go to sleep."). Films don't have chapters.
  Besides, I think they interfere with the shape of the story. Use a
  bookmark is my advice."

  "I have to shove them in the putative YA books because my editor screams
  until I do."

- On Discworld language use.

  "A certain amount of DW slang comes from Palari or Polari, the fairground
  / underworld / theatre 'secret language' (which seems to have a lot of
  roots in old Italian). UK readers with long memories might recall the
  pair of gay actors 'Julian and Sandy', in the old Round the Horne radio
  show in the Sixties and Seventies (innocent times, innocent times); they
  spoke almost pure Palari."

- Why don't you use a Macintosh for your writing?

  "In fact I type so fluently that I can't deal with a mouse. My mother
  paid for me to have touch-typing lessons when I was 13, and they took.
  Hah! I can just see a DW book written with voice-recognition software!
  Especially in this cat-ridden house! 'That's Ankh-Morpork, you bloody
  stupid machine! GET OFF THE TURNTABLE!' As to goshwowness – well, it
  seems now that a 50MHz 486 is what you need if you're not going to have
  silicon kicked in your face on the beach. But... Macs do interest me...
  it's just that I associate them with manipulation rather than input."

- Where are all these references to science, physics in particular, coming
  from?

  "How much physics do I know? How do I know that? I don't know about the
  stuff I don't know. I've no formal training but I've spent a lot of time
  around scientists of one sort of another, and I'm a great believer in
  osmotic knowledge."

  [ People on the net (who tend to have a university or technical
  background) are often impressed by Terry's many references to the
  physical sciences in his novels ("Oh wow, you can really tell he used to
  work for a nuclear power plant!" is an often-heard cry), but frankly I
  think they are underestimating the non-university audience out there.
  Most of the things Terry mentions in passing (e.g. Big Bang, quarks,
  wave/particle duality) are covered in high school physics classes (or at
  least in Holland they are), and surely everybody who does not
  deliberately turn away from anything scientific in content will have seen
  references in newspapers, on tv or in magazines to things like quantum
  particles or the "Trousers of Time"? ]

- How do you write?

  "How do I write? God, this is embarrassing. Look, I just do it. It's
  pictures in the head and memories and thinking about things and it all
  comes together. It's something I do."

  "1) Watch everything, read everything, and especially read outside your
  subject – you should be importing, not recycling.

  2) Use a wordprocessor... why do I feel this is not unnecessary advice
  here? It makes everything mutable. It's better for the ego. And you can
  play games when all else fails.

  3) Write. For more than three years I wrote more than 400 words every
  day. I mean, every calendar day. If for some reason, in those
  pre-portable days, I couldn't get to a keyboard, I wrote hard the
  previous night and caught up the following day, and if it ever seemed
  that it was easy to do the average I upped the average. I also did a hell
  of a lot of editing afterwards but the point was there *was* something
  there to edit. I had a more than full-time job as well. I hate to say
  this, but most of the successful (well, okay... *rich*) authors I know
  seem to put 'application' around the top of the list of How-to-do-its.
  Tough but true."

  "Application? Well, it means... application. The single-minded ability to
  knuckle down and get on with it, as they say in Unseen University
  library."

- The advantages of having a background in journalism.

  "Yes, Dave Gemmell and Neil Gaiman were both journalists. So was Bob
  Shaw. So was I. It's good training because:

      1) any tendency to writers' block is burned out of you within a few
         weeks of starting work by unsympathetic news editors;

      2) you very quickly learn the direct link between writing and eating;

      3) you pick up a style of sorts;

      4) you get to hang around in interesting places;

      5) you learn to take editing in your stride, and tend to be reliable
         about deadlines;

      6) you end up with an ability to think at the keyboard and reduce the
         world to yourself and the work in hand – you have to do this to
         survive in a world of ringing telephones and shouting sub-editors.

  None of this makes you talented or *good*, but it does help you make the
  best of what you've got."

- On the use of dog-Latin.

  "People in the UK, even in public (i.e., private) schools, don't assume
  that "everyone knows Latin". Latin is barely taught anywhere anymore –
  it certainly wasn't taught to me. But dog-Latin *isn't* Latin, except by
  accident. It's simply made-up, vaguely Latin-sounding phrases, as in Nil
  Illegitimo Carborundum. 'Fabricati Diem, Punc' is total nonsense in Latin
  [no doubt there are readers out there who could construct the correct
  phrase that might have fallen from the lips of Dirty Hadrian]."

- On the writing of "`Good Omens`_".

  "Neil and I had known each other since early 1985. Doing it was our idea,
  not a publisher's deal."

  "I think this is an honest account of the process of writing "`Good
  Omens`_". It was fairly easy to keep track of because of the way we sent
  discs to one another, and because I was Keeper of the Official Master
  Copy I can say that I wrote a bit over two thirds of "`Good Omens`_".
  However, we were on the phone to each other every day, at least once. If
  you have an idea during a brainstorming session with another guy, whose
  idea is it? One guy goes and writes 2,000 words after thirty minutes on
  the phone, what exactly is the process that's happening?

  I did most of the physical writing because:

      1) I had to. Neil had to keep **Sandman** going – I could take time
         off from the DW;

      2) One person has to be overall editor, and do all the stitching and
         filling and slicing and, as I've said before, it was me by
         agreement – if it had been a graphic novel, it would have been
         Neil taking the chair for exactly the same reasons it was me for a
         novel;

      3) I'm a selfish bastard and tried to write ahead to get to the good
         bits before Neil.

  Initially, I did most of Adam and the Them and Neil did most of the Four
  Horsemen, and everything else kind of got done by whoever – by the end,
  large sections were being done by a composite creature called
  Terryandneil, whoever was actually hitting the keys. By agreement, I am
  allowed to say that Agnes Nutter, her life and death, was completely and
  utterly mine. And Neil proudly claims responsibility for the maggots.
  Neil's had a major influence on the opening scenes, me on the ending. In
  the end, it was this book done by two guys, who shared the money equally
  and did it for fun and wouldn't do it again for a big clock."

  "Yes, the maggot reversal was by me, with a gun to Neil's head (although
  he understood the reasons, it's just that he likes maggots). There
  couldn't be blood on Adam's hands, even blood spilled by third parties.
  No-one should die because he was alive."

- On rumours that Neil Gaiman claims to have come up with some of the ideas
  in "`Reaper Man`_", most notably the title and the Death storyline.

  "To the best of my recollection the Reaper Man title was suggested by
  Faith Brooker at Gollancz (although I can't swear to this). But I know,
  and have gone on record about this, that the central idea of Reaper Man
  actually came from reading a fan letter from a lady who wrote "Death is
  my favourite character – he can be my knight on a white charger any day
  of the week". The lady concerned can be produced to the court, m'lud.

  Listening intelligently while a fellow author talks about an upcoming
  book isn't the same as 'suggesting the storyline and some other bits' and
  in fairness to Neil I doubt that he put it quite like that – this sounds
  like something which has picked up a bit of spin in the telling. We've
  known each other for a long time, we share a similar conceptual universe
  – we'd both agree happily that he has the darker end of it – and we've
  often talked about what we're working on and tried out stuff on one
  another. And that's it, really."

- How big is his publisher's influence on what gets written?

  "Question was: do the publishers force me to write DW books? (the subtext
  being, we'd like you to do other stuff). And the answer is, no, you can't
  work like that. It works the other way round – I say I'm planning two
  more, they say, fine, here's a contract. The DW is sufficiently big and
  vague that it can cover "`Small Gods`_" and "Eric_", so I've got a wide field
  to work in. But... I'll say here again... the days of twice-yearly DW
  books have probably gone. I'm still planning to write them regularly, in
  fact publishing schedules might end up bringing out two in a year, but I
  want to do other stuff as well. The fact is that each DW book sells more
  than the one before, and the backlist sales keep on rising. I don't write
  DW *because* of this, but it suggests that there's a readership out
  there. I can't imagine how anyone can be *forced* to write a book."

- On the joint copyright notice in his novels.

  [ All Terry's novels are "copyright Terry and Lyn Pratchett", and people
  on the net were wondering about the reasons for it. ]

  "Copyright does not necessarily have anything to do with authorship – an
  author can assign copyright wherever he or she likes. Lyn and I are a
  legal partnership, and so we hold copyright jointly (for various mildly
  beneficial reasons) in the same way that, if we ever bothered to form a
  limited company, *that* would hold the copyright. At random I've picked a
  few favourite books off the shelf, and can say that it's not unusual for
  copyright not to be held simply in the name of the author. I do all the
  writing!"

- On the various Discworld covers.

  "No, Kirby's Nanny Ogg is pretty good. And he's getting better (...he's
  getting better...) at someone who looks about right for Magrat. But he
  hasn't really got a clue about Granny.

  The artist who does the American book club editions – can't recall his
  name – does not, I think, do good *covers*, but he makes a very good job
  of getting the characters right. They're not *my* idea of the characters,
  but they're certainly based squarely on the plot. His Granny on the cover
  of Equal Rites was notable."

  "The next UK paperback reprint of TCOM (they do a couple a year) will not
  have a Kirby cover. This is an experiment – there's been feedback to me
  and to Transworld that suggests there are a large number of potential DW
  readers out there who think they don't like fantasy and don't get past
  the Kirby covers."

  [ Scans of both the original Josh Kirby cover and of the new cover by
  Stephen Player are available from the Pratchett Archives. ]

  "Current cover policy is to have a fairly small graphic on the front of
  the hardcovers but a full traditional design on the front of the
  paperback; I'm not too unhappy about this, because I wasn't very keen on
  the "`Lords and Ladies`_" hardcover artwork."

- On American editions of his books.

  "I'm also nervy about 'translating' things into American. ("Friends,
  Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears = Yo, muthers,
  y'knowwhatI'msayin?") I've seen what even intelligent, well-travelled
  American writers think is normal British conversation ("I say, good
  show!") and I'd hate to be guilty of that sort of thing in reverse."

  "As far as "`Johnny and the Dead`_" and "`Only You Can Save Mankind`_" are
  concerned: well, I dunno. It was bad enough having to translate Truckers
  into American, and then it was published so badly by Dell in hardcover we
  took the paperback rights away from them (which we are looking to sell
  now). And the two more recent books are very British, or at least
  European – I can just imagine the dog's breakfast an US editor would
  make of them. My agent's got 'em, but I'm not that keen to sell."

- On reference books.

  "I've got Brewer's, of course <<See the annotation for p. 117/103 of "`The
  Colour of Magic`_">>, and if I need an instant reference it's a handy book.
  He also did a **Reader's Companion** which is even better. But Ebenezer is
  only the tip of an iceberg of similar books, of which the Victorians were
  very fond."

  "Whenever I go to the States I always return with my luggage stuffed with
  Panati's and **Straight Dope** books <<See the annotation for p. 165/107 of
  "`Good Omens`_">> (I've seen the **Straight Dope** books here, but never seen
  an imported Panati (they've got titles like "Extraordinary Origins of
  Everyday Things")). I'm afraid I spend money like water in American book
  shops; I dunno, they just seem more inviting. The oddest book shop I've
  been in is Win Bundy's Singing Wind Book Ranch..."

- Likes and Dislikes.

  "I *hated* the Alice books."

  "I didn't like the Alice books because I found them creepy and horribly
  unfunny in a nasty, plonking, Victorian way. Oh, here's Mr Christmas
  Pudding On Legs, hohohoho, here's a Caterpillar Smoking A Pipe, hohohoho.
  When I was a kid the books created in me about the same revulsion as you
  get when, aged seven, you're invited to kiss your great-grandmother."

  "May I also add that the film **The Return of Captain Invincible**, which
  is a series of bad moments pasted together with great songs and a budget
  of fourpence, is also a regularly-viewed video in the Pratchett
  household. And David Byrne's **True Stories** also. Flame me if you wish. I
  laugh with scorn at threats."

  "These are modern authors whose books I will automatically buy knowing
  that life is going to get that little bit richer:

      George McDonald Fraser (The Flashman books)
      Carl Hiaasen (still to get well known over here)
      Donald Westlake (a pro)
      Joseph Wambaugh
      Tom Robbins

  But I read more and more non-fiction, biographies and stuff these days."

  [About Joanna Trollope:] "An intelligent lady who writes worthwhile books
  for an audience largely neglected by 'real' writers, and who occasionally
  comes up with a bit of description I really wish I'd thought of. The
  current TV adaptation of **The Rector's Wife** is pretty awful."

  [About P. J. O'Rourke:] "PJ may be many things, but fascist he is not, as
  becomes obvious when you read his slightly more serious writings – but
  he clearly does like to wind up the kind of people who are too free with
  'fascist' accusations. He's so far to the right that on many issues he's
  coming back at you from the left. [...] I like PJ."

  "I got Corgi to republish Roy Lewis' **The Evolution Man** a few years ago.
  To the best of my knowledge it's the only fiction he's done. Like I said
  in my intro, it's honest, genuine sf... and one of my all-time favourite
  funny books."

  "If anyone can ever get hold of it, the classic funny cricket match was
  in the book **England, Their England** by A. G. McDonnell. A forgotten
  masterpiece."

  "[Carl Hiaassen] is a writer I try to promote here at every opportunity.
  He hasn't written a bad book. I recommend **Native Tongue** or maybe
  **Double Whammy**."

- Is there any truth to the rumour that you and Neil Gaiman had a fall-out
  over the "`Good Omens`_" film project?

  "Me and Neil... oh gawd. Yes, it's true to say we didn't agree over the
  way the film should be going. But that's about it. There's no flying
  daggers – at least, I haven't thrown any and none have hit me."

- Speaking of movies, what happened to the plans for a movie based on
  "Mort_"?

  "A production company was put together and there was US and Scandinavian
  and European involvement, and I wrote a couple of script drafts which
  went down well and everything was looking fine and then the US people
  said "Hey, we've been doing market research in Power Cable, Nebraska, and
  other centres of culture, and the Death/skeleton bit doesn't work for us,
  it's a bit of a downer, we have a prarm with it, so lose the skeleton".
  The rest of the consortium said, did you read the script? The Americans
  said: sure, we LOVE it, it's GREAT, it's HIGH CONCEPT. Just lose the
  Death angle, guys.

  Whereupon, I'm happy to say, they were told to keep on with the
  medication and come back in a hundred years."

  "The person also said that Americans "weren't ready for the treatment of
  Death as an amusing and sympathetic character". This was about 18
  months/2 years before **Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey**."

  "Currently, since the amount of money available for making movies in
  Europe is about sixpence, the consortium is looking for some more
  intelligent Americans in the film business. This may prove difficult.

  It could have been worse. I've heard what "`Good Omens`_" was looking like
  by the time Sovereign's option mercifully ran out – set in America, no
  Four Horsemen... oh god."

  "What you have to remember is that in the movies there are two types of
  people 1) the directors, artists, actors and so on who have to *do*
  things and are often quite human and 2) the other lifeforms.
  Unfortunately you have to deal with the other lifeforms first. It is
  impossible to exaggerate their baleful stupidity."

- If movies are too expensive, how about some more Discworld television
  adaptations?

  "There's some approaches. There's *always* some approaches. But too often
  they're from people who want to do a 'funny fantasy' and paste the
  Discworld label on it. I have to repeat the old mantra: Discworld isn't
  internally funny to the people who live there – there's no baseball
  playing frogs. And too often the approach is [sub-text] "I bet a humble
  print author like you would be overjoyed to be on REAL TELEVISION, eh?"
  They get what Nanny Ogg calls the derriere velocitie PDQ, I can tell
  you."

  "We are talking usefully to UK TV people and, yes, there is serious
  interest in doing the Guards books as a sort of 'Hill Street Octarines'.
  It might work. Even if it doesn't, people are close enough for me to
  scream at them."

  "IF IT ALL HAPPENS ('cos we're dealing with screen here) then there would
  be "`Guards! Guards!`_" as the pilot and "`Men at Arms`_" as 'the series'."

- Why does the Librarian have such troubles communicating with humans?
  Surely, as a highly trained, intelligent librarian he is literate, and
  therefore can write down what he wants to say?

  "Personally, I think he does it out of spite."

- Responding to newspaper articles mentioning "Estimated wealth of sci-fi
  novelist Terry Pratchett: UK# 26,500,000".

  "This began with some survey done by a magazine called **Business Age**.
  Since it's off by the national debt of Belgium my agent rang them up to
  find out what the hell was going on. Various factoids emerged, like
  frinstance their assumption that I sell pro rata as much in the States as
  I do here (hollow laughter from the American readers). And we suspect
  they fall for the common error that a mere appearance in the bestseller
  lists means millionaire status (in a poor week the book at number ten
  might not have sold 100 copies). But the big wobbler is that the estimate
  is of 'worth', not 'wealth' – they've hazarded a wild guess at the value
  of the Discworld *rights*, as far as we can tell including film rights as
  well. Remember copyright lasts for 50 years and the books are consistent
  high backlist sellers. It's similar to pointing to a bright kid and
  saying 'he's worth three million quids' – i.e., all the money she or he
  *might* earn during their life, at compound interest. It's fairy money.
  The kind Robert Maxwell had."

- On his perennial problems with publishers in America.

  "Well, I sell some [books]. I had a sort of publisher, in the same way
  that duckweed counts as a plant. Let's hope HarperCollins does better."

  "I can only repeat: my last publishers were so good they spelled my name
  wrong in the books, made sure they had covers in 50 shades of mud, and
  kept them out of the shops. HarperCollins are bringing out "`Small Gods`_"
  in January and are talking about some kind of accelerated schedule to
  catch up.

  I've seen the US "`Small Gods`_" cover, by the way. It's quite different
  from anything else of mine, and mainly text... looks rather posh..."

  "HarperCollins have been sent the "`Soul Music`_" MS and are serious about
  publishing it this summer in an effort to 'catch up'. That means in
  theory that new Discworld books should be published in the US at (more or
  less) the same time as in the UK. But it leaves "`Lords and Ladies`_" and
  "`Men at Arms`_" in a kind of limbo; HC are committed to bringing them out
  "as soon as possible" and it's in their interests to do so, because
  they've had to front advances which they can't recoup until they start
  selling."

  "Blame publishers. HarperCollins have got "`Lords and Ladies`_", "`Small
  Gods`_", "`Men at Arms`_" and "`Soul Music`_". I *think* Roc have got "Eric_". I'd
  be happy to see them all out in one go. As for the Map... I suspect it'll
  never get a US publication. It seemed to frighten US publishers. They
  don't seem to understand it.

  "That seems to point up a significant difference between Europeans and
  Americans:

  A European says: I can't understand this, what's wrong with me? An
  American says: I can't understand this, what's wrong with him?

  I make no suggestion that one side or other is right, but observation
  over many years leads me to believe it is true."

  "The last I heard, my editor was mumbling a bit over [the Johnny books].
  Though he personally loved J&tD I think he thought Americans wouldn't (as
  in: no-one in the book is American, WWI happened on another continent
  that American kids couldn't find on an atlas with three tries, and it
  feels, ugh, European. I'm paraphrasing his far more diplomatically worded
  comments)."

  As I understand it, "`Lords and Ladies`_" and "`Men at Arms`_" will come out in
  trade paperback "fairly soon" after "`Soul Music`_", to get them out of the
  way – ie, to desperately try to catch up on the schedule. But it looks
  as though SM is slipping back, 'cos I saw the proofs only a week or so
  ago. Basically, it's the usual arrogance of US publishers towards their
  readers – and counter-productive, since I know that quite a large number
  of UK editions find their way into the US."

  "The twisted thinking is as follows. Thousands of hardcover UK Discworld
  books cross the Atlantic after every pub date, certainly undermining the
  sales or potential sales of US copies; this pattern has become
  established because of the long delay before US publication.
  HarperCollins thought the only way they could retrieve the situation was
  leap the gap and publish the next 'new' title as soon as possible,
  bringing out the other two over the next year more or less as 'new
  backlist titles' while also continuing to publish genuinely new Discworld
  books. This would mean that "`Lords and Ladies`_" and "`Men At Arms`_" would be
  late, but they'd have been late *anyway*, and titles from "`Soul Music`_" on
  would have an American pub. date pretty close to the UK one.

  That was the theory. Unfortunately, it has contained one major flaw, in
  that it is being put into practice. It seems to be thought that a
  publication date for "`Soul Music`_" that is 7-8 months behind the UK one is
  'contemporary', which is an interesting use of the word. Moreover, I have
  a horrible suspicion that they'll see two 'new' Pratchett books on their
  list next year and, on the basis that the left hand does not know what
  the left hand is doing, decide that 'Interesting Times' can be postponed
  until 1996 (having come out in the UK in November, 1994).

  Sometimes I think I'd have done better staying with Roc, sad covers and
  all – at least they were catching up..."

- Is "Strata_" a Discworld novel or isn't it?

  ""Strata_" used the idea of a Discworld but I've never thought of it as a
  Discworld novel within the meaning of the act. The first Discworld novel
  was "`The Colour of Magic`_". Let the message go throughout the kingdom..."

- About the Discworld album by Dave Greenslade.

  "It's called **From The Discworld**. Most of the tracks are themes for the
  books (I particularly like the Small Gods one) but there are two songs,
  'The Shades of Ankh-Morpork' and something about a wizard's staff. There
  is also the insidious tune of the 'Stick and Bucket Dance', even down to
  that special chord folk music has to have at the end so that people know
  they can come out now."

  The CD was released by Virgin (UK:CDV 2738), and features the following
  tracks:

        1. A'Tuin the Turtle
        2. Octarine The Colour of Magic
        3. The Luggage
        4. The Shades of Ankh-Morpork
        5. Wyrd Sisters
        6. The Unseen University/The Librarian
        7. Death
        8. A Wizard's Staff has a Knob on the End
        9. Dryads
        10. Pyramids
        11. Small Gods
        12. Stick and Bucket Dance
        13. The One Horseman and the Three pedestrians of the Apocralypse
        14. Holy Wood Dreams

- At the end of "Wings_" you implied that the Nomes would return some day
  for any remaining Nomes. Do you plan to write another book where the
  Nomes return or one about the world the Nomes now call home?

  "I won't do one about any new planets, but there may be another book
  about the nomes."

- On computer games.

  "I have played **Elite**, **Wing Commander**, **X-Wing** and altogether too
  many outer-space-shoot-em-ups. I mean, don't they all have shields,
  missiles and stuff?"

  "Well, right now I'm storming through **Privateer** under the callsign of
  Flash Bastard, whose career has progressed throughout the whole Wing
  Commander series."

- Are "Diggers_" and "Wings_" going to be made into TV programs as follow-ups
  to "Truckers_"?

  "Cosgrove Hall were just getting them storyboarded when Thames folded.
  They're still not a dead issue, but suffering as do many things when
  people at the top change: no-one likes to be associated with something
  started before their time."

  "Cosgrove Hall still want to do them. They're also interested in... well,
  other stuff I've done. Right now a number of other people have come out
  of the woodwork with money and interesting ideas – J&tD seems like a
  starter, for one. But the BBC does not figure largely in current
  approaches."

- Why isn't the Ankh-Morpork Mappe released as a poster?

  "Transworld have considered doing the Mappe as a poster. There are snags.
  Where does the key go? The key as a booklet attached for some reason
  avoids the dreaded VAT; as a poster, VAT would be on it."

- About future Discworld merchandising:

  "Ankh-Morpork postcards will probably happen. There was a recent meeting
  to thrash out the whole T-shirts/calendars/towel and body splash thing,
  and they (and Discworld stationery) were near the top of the list..."

- About the continuing rumours that he will soon be sanctioning an official
  fan club.

  "It's the word 'official' that always pulls me up. It suggests I've got
  some kind of control or stake and I wouldn't want that. The best I can
  say is that, over the past few months (after hearing that Clarecraft's
  Discworld collectors club membership is in the high hundreds, and
  [Stephen Briggs] is disappearing under scarves) is that I'm no longer
  killing people who say they think one would be a good idea, since there
  are clearly many (if you can believe this) *people out there with no net
  access* who want some kind of Discworld club. I'm not sure that's the
  answer you're looking for..."

- Do you deliver your manuscripts in digital form?

  "The US publishers want discs. Gollancz tried setting from disc a few
  years ago and it seemed quite successful, but I think it stopped when the
  lad who knew how to work their Amstrad moved on. I've been set from disc
  once or twice by Corgi. But the instant-books you're looking for won't
  happen because: 1) books have to be scheduled ahead of time, for cost,
  sales and PR reasons 2) it's easier to squeeze a melon though the eye of
  a needle than it is to get a UK publisher to think in other than
  Gutenberg terms."

  "Basically, most publishers still hanker for paper MS – even the ones
  that can set from disc want a print-out too. [...] So now we're back to
  typos hand-set by experts (anyone who got that red and black eight page
  'extract' piece with my moody pic on the front that came out about two
  years ago will see what a creative typesetter can do – there is at least
  one really creative typo per page). Mind you, copy-editors can be bad –
  it's taken me a long time to make mine understand that there is a
  distinct difference between Mr and Mister. Mr = minor honorific, an
  invisible word, Mister = John Wayne getting angry."

- A philosophical question: why are elves considered evil, while cats (who
  do the same nasty things) are not?

  "Ahem....

  There is no inconsistency. Nanny Ogg has a point of view. So has Death.
  So have I. But there's no such thing as 'the official Discworld opinion'
  on, say, cats.

  Personally, I like cats. And they are also nasty cruel bastards. Just ask
  that two-thirds of a shrew that's outside our back door right now."

  "Okay, try this. Cats are nasty cruel bastards but that's because they
  are cats. As far as we know, they have no grasp of the concept of not
  being nasty cruel bastards. Humans, on the other hand, do."

- About the spoken-word versions of the Discworld novels.

  "Transworld intended to bring out *all* the Discworld on tape eventually
  – I think the first three titles are coming out RSN." [ RSN = Real Soon
  Now ]

  "There may be Braille/audiotape versions by people like Books For The
  Blind. Every so often I get requests – as do most authors, I expect –
  to allow Braille editions and special tapes, and we always say, "fine,
  sure, no fee, no problem". But we NEVER GET TOLD WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. So I
  don't know what's out there. It's a bit of a shame."

- On the subject of dedications.

  "With the exception of requests, like "Can you sign it to Scrummybunikins
  with lots of Hugs", there are about 35 different Discworld dedications
  (some of which I don't have time to do with the queues being the length
  they are – if you've got the Death Grin dedication in "Mort_", treasure
  it, because I hardly ever do it these days). As for quality of
  handwriting, well, mine never was good...

  Far More Wishes is part of a set (Best Wishes, Better Wishes, Even Better
  Wishes, More Wishes, Far More Wishes, Still More Wishes, Extra Wishes, A
  Whole New Quantum of Wishes and – for those people with two carrier bags
  full of books – Son of Best Wishes, Bride of Best Wishes, and Return of
  the Killer Best Wishes for 20,000 Fathoms). Also look out for the special
  Boo! in "Mort_" and "`Reaper Man`_", our new Read it And Reap one in "`Reaper
  Man`_", the special turtle drawing in "`Small Gods`_", and various Now Reads
  Ons, Enhanced Wishes, etc, etc. Kids! Collect the Entire Set!"

  [ This explanation prompted FAQ maintainer Nathan Torkington to reply
  with:

  "I can't wait to see what happens when you reach the fifty book mark, and
  people at the head of the queue say "just wait a sec and I'll back the
  car in". The dedications will probably be:

   * Fuck off
   * Go away
   * Read Douglas Adams
   * Get a life
   * Get a job
   * Don't you have anything *better* to do with your time
   * Son of fuck off
   * My god, did I really write all these damn books
   * Yes, by god, I *do* regret it now
   * Worst wishes
   * I don't know why I don't have a rubber stamp made
   * Look, just bugger off I'm fed up to the teeth with banana daiquiris
   * I wish I *had* said "money"
   * This is the last dedication
   * Bloody trade editions
   * Oh, how cute, you have the hardback and paperback editions
   * Oh, and the US ones too
   * I'm memorising your face and your adenoidal laugh
   * You're next, matey
   * Third prodigal son of a fling with the daughter of the baker to fuck off"

  Terry was very impressed by this list, and so were other readers of
  a.f.p. Terry says that since this discussion appeared on the net he is
  now occasionally asked for specific dedications along these lines. ]

  "Book-specific ones tend to be: "Mort_" and "`Reaper Man`_": 'Boo!', 'HAVE
  FUN', the Death grin, or 'Read It And Reap'. "`Small Gods`_": almost always
  'The Turtle Moves!' "`Pyramids`_": usually the 'Hi! in the Pyramid' "`Wyrd
  Sisters`_": often 'Really wyrd'..."

  "Read It And Reap has now been established as a 'generic' line which
  doesn't *just* get used in "`Reaper Man`_"."

- What order are the Discworld books in?

  "As far as I am concerned, the Discworld books are in chronological
  order. Anything that suggests differently is probably because of the
  Trousers of Time, magical leakage from the HEM and so on..."

- It was rumoured in **Octarine** magazine that you and Robert Rankin were
  not "the best of friends". Any truth to this? (By the way: I hear that
  Rankin likes to throw wild parties in his jacuzzi.)

  "I'll nail this one right now. We don't see much of one another but we
  get on fine. That was **Octarine** stirring it up. I know nothing
  whatsoever about parties in jacuzzis, or rubber chickens."

- More about book shop tours and signing sessions.

  "Well, the tour's over, and back I come to unload a stack of emails
  including a few on the lines of: some signings were chaos/badly organised
  (I'll better add that they added: we know it wasn't your fault, you were
  distantly seen to be scribbling at speed...). Some interesting points
  were raised so, in honour of the afp'ers who queued, I thought I'd post a
  general reply here.

  I don't organise signings. The *publishers* don't organise signings;
  shops clamour to get certain authors, and the publishers try to select
  the few dozen for this tour based on all kinds of stuff like number of
  shops already picked in that chain, location and so on. But the
  organisation of the signing itself is done by the shop. Not all of them
  can hack it. Believe me, I know this, and the reasons include:

      * this shop's idea of a good signing hitherto is fifty people
      * this shop doesn't understand about, er, a 'fan' type signing,
        where there's dedications and maybe some older titles and an
        occasional brief chat.
      * the shop doesn't understand about signings *at all*, including the
        need for a proper table and chair for the signer, or a cup of tea.
        It happens. I carry my own bag of pens because most shops would
        provide one Biro.

  A lot of them *can* run a signing, and the problems simply are the
  unavoidable ones you have if 300 people all want a book signed at the
  same time, *and* want to say "hi".

  I'm sort of stuck. I can't run the thing from the desk. Besides, I was
  signing for six or seven hours most days, and my brain turns to cheese.
  My PR lady can help a bit, and does. If we spot a handicapped person in
  the queue, and tactful inquiry suggests they'd welcome it, they get to
  the front (I have to say that, to my annoyance, the staff in some shops
  seemed oblivious to this aspect). If the shop runs out of a title – it
  happened a few times – she can get some from the reps secret stash.

  On this tour I think that, despite my warnings, I signed everything. Most
  of the time people with a big stack were asked to wait until the end. I'm
  loathe to let shops decide how many books I'm going to sign so they're
  told that I'll sign everything if there's time – otherwise, in an effort
  to be helpful, they'd make their own rules.

  Some problems would be solved by doing fewer signings (and people'd
  complain). We left out too many places this time as it was.

  It definitely was a busy tour. I would like to apologise to the relatives
  of the fan who gave me 29 books to sign in Odyssey 7, Manchester. I'm a
  little twitchy towards the end of a day of signing and did not mean to
  kill and eat him."

  "With a little more leisure I realise that the aforesaid postings
  concerned one particular shop. They did indeed seem far more interested
  in shifting books than running a proper signing, and this has been
  carefully noted for future reference. They had also not spotted that an
  author, in order to sign, needs a table and a chair.

  But a lot of shops seemed to do it well – the Waterstones in Manchester,
  for example, seemed very good at hustling pregnant ladies, etc, to the
  front of the queue. In fact I think you merely had to look as though your
  feet hurt.

  Signings that don't involve a talk are invariably advertised as 'an
  hour'. But there's always some extra time in the program."

  "Some shops on the tour – they have been noted – acted as if having a
  shop full of people buying books was terribly inconvenient. I know that
  one stopped taking phone orders because the staff got fed up."

  "On the latest tour I've heard that some shops have been telling people
  'he'll only sign "`Soul Music`_"'. This is shopspeak on the lines of "It's
  out of print" (which really means "Who cares and bugger off, you pimply
  person"). Shops have no say in what I'll sign or not sign. So I'll
  repeat:

  I'll sign everything of mine – if there's time. It's all down to queue
  length. If you've got an entire bag of books then generally I arrange to
  sign them after the queue has gone. You don't even have to buy the
  current title, although you may be subject to some righteous wragging if
  this is the case."

  "The tour just finished may have been the first one in which someone
  brought a computer in to be signed – a Sparc workstation, I recall."

  "I'm not against flash photography! But repeated flash photography during
  a long day – well, ever tried looking down at a white page after staring
  into a flash gun?"

  "What is always very touching are the people who bring in their *already
  signed* books to witness the new ones being signed. It's like their first
  Communion or something..."

- Is the Mappe of Ankh-Morpork based on London?

  "We started with a LOT of real cities – mostly in England, mostly old.
  There's a lot of Oxford and some Durham and Shrewsbury and odds and ends
  from everywhere, including a street in Abingdon opposite the theatre that
  puts on the Discworld plays. I think Stephen even said somewhere that
  London isn't the only city with a Hyde Park, but I could be wrong. But
  frankly any old city with a wall and a wiggly river looks like
  London...."

- Do religious fanatics ever get mad at you for writing "`Small Gods`_"?

  "I may have posted something on these lines before, but a lot of mail
  about "`Small Gods`_" is split between 1) pagans who say that it really
  shafts the Big Beard In the Sky religions and 2) Christians who say that
  it is an incredibly pro-Christian book.

  I suspect the latter is because Brutha displays tolerance, compassion,
  charity, steadfastness and faith, and these are now considered Christian
  virtues (i.e., virtues that modern Christians feel they should have...)"

- Annotations and References.

  "If I put a reference in a book I try to pick one that a generally
  well-read (well-viewed, well-listened) person has a sporting chance of
  picking up; I call this 'white knowledge', the sort of stuff that fills
  up your brain without you really knowing where it came from. Enough
  people would've read Leiber, say, to pick up a generalised reference to
  Fafhrd, etc., and even more people would have some knowledge of Tolkien
  – but I wouldn't rely on people having read a specific story."

  "I like doing this kind of thing. There are a number of passages in the
  books which are 'enhanced' if you know where the echoes are coming from
  but which are still, I hope, funny in their own right."

  "Sometimes I... well... I just write stuff which hasn't been pinched from
  ANYONE (shuffles feet, looks embarrassed...)."

- When will you be visiting the USA?

  "The publishers keep on saying "We've got to bring you over next year". I
  think I've found the logical flaw in this invitation..."

Editorial Comments

The Origin Of The APF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first person ever to publicly suggest the concept of collecting
annotations for Terry's books was Tor Iver Wilhelmsen, a Usenet poster from
Norway. On 2 February 1992 (this was all of three days after
alt.fan.pratchett was created!), he wrote in a message to the newsgroup:

"Does anyone feel up to compiling a list of the various references to other
works that crops up in Pratchett's works, such as the Lovecraftian
inspirations (Bel-Shammaroth, the Dungeon Dimensions, The Place The Dragons
Dwell etc.), more like an 'annotations' collection??"

There was no immediate response, but Nathan Torkington started maintaining
a broader FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions list) for the newsgroup soon
after that, and included a couple of explanations of references that were
cropping up often.

People continued asking for explanations and discovering new references,
however, and on 29 July 1992 I posted the following message (in a
discussion about "`Small Gods`_", which had just been released):

"It's difficult to come up with more "`Small Gods`_" gags from memory, though.
There were so many I'm sure I did not get all of the references.

Which brings me to the fact that I more and more wish that there was an
"Annotated Pratchett" file somewhere. The FAQ makes a good start, but it
could be a whole project in its own right.

Tell you what; if people are interested in this, I'm willing to start the
Annotated Pratchett Project right here and now."

The reaction to this proposal was overwhelming (well, Nathan thought it was
a good idea – turns out I didn't need any more encouragement than that),
and eventually the first publicly released version of the APF (v1.4) was
posted to alt.fan.pratchett on 12 August 1992. This time there really was a
large and enthusiastic response on the newsgroup, and from then on the APF
was a going concern.

Credits
~~~~~~~

People who write articles to the Pratchett newsgroups or who email me
annotations should always be aware of one thing: for the APF I will freely
quote and copy from your submissions, without further explicit permission
or credit.

It's not only that I think long lists of contributors' names would be a
bother to maintain (we're talking about many hundreds of names here), would
make the APF even larger than it already is, and would be completely
uninteresting to anybody except the contributors themselves; but doing it
my way also allows me to edit, change, and mutilate the texts as I see fit
without worrying about folks going: "but that's not what I said!".

Explicitly marked quotes (i.e. the material placed between quotation marks
and preceded by a source attribution) form the exception to this rule. In
particular when including quotes from Terry Pratchett himself, I will choose
a selection in the first place, fix typos or obvious syntactical mistakes,
and adapt punctuation to conform to the rest of the APF, but I will make no
further edits or changes. In other words: What You See Is What He Said.

Apart from all the folks who contributed annotations, there are heaps of
people who have gone out of their way to help me get the APF into its
current form, and thanking them is certainly something that I don't mind
spending a few paragraphs on.

First and foremost, I have to thank Mike Kew, my Assistant Editor, who came
aboard in 2000 and basically did the hardest and most thankless bits of
work for the various 7a.5.x releases. His efforts kept the APF going in its
darkest hours, and without him v9.0 would not yet have seen the light of
day.

I would also like to thank all the APF proofreaders, beta-testers and
fact-checkers (by now again too many to list separately), who have helped
exterminate typos and grammar errors while improving quote and page number
accuracy. It's mindnumbingly boring work, and you have no idea how much I
appreciate not having to do it all by myself.

There are a number of people who have been so instrumental over the years I
would like to mention and thank them individually:

Nathan Torkington and Andy "&." Holyer, for being there at the beginning
and helping to get the whole thing rolling.

Sander Plomp, for the logs of early alt.fan.pratchett newsgroup traffic,
and for coming up with the idea of making a LaTeX version of the APF.

Robert Collier, for his work on the original HTML version of the APF.

Paulius Stepanas, for his help with the double page numbers. I once
promised that the "conversion function" would be a part of APF v9.0 – but
it was not to be, and I apologise...

Trent Fisher and David Jones, for helping me out in the beginning with Perl
and LaTeX programming, respectively.

Last, but not least: Terry Pratchett, for giving us something to annotate
in the first place; for giving me permission to use quotes from his
articles in the APF; and for having to put up with increasing numbers of
fans who, perhaps because of the APF, have begun to think he is incapable
of writing anything truly original. They should know better.


Page Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Up to APF v7a.0, each annotation was identified (in addition to the
relevant quote from the book) by two page numbers: one for the Gollancz
hardcover and one for the Corgi paperback. Unfortunately, this system has a
number of drawbacks.

One minor problem is that I have never liked the look of those double
page numbers. The "247/391" strings look ugly, bloat the text, and make
the annotations just that tiny bit harder to read.

A more serious problem is that having two page numbers is a maintenance
headache. Double the numbers means double the chance of mistakes. And
since I don't own Terry's books in both hardcover and paperback editions
myself, I have to rely on volunteers to supply fully half of the data I
need: all the page numbers for the editions of the books I don't have.

Thankfully, so far I *have* had the help of volunteers who have done a
stellar job on this, but it does still mean that I can never just add an
annotation without having to go bother someone else for the second page
number. This makes annotating a two-step process, which is especially
tiresome now that APF updates are supposed to happen in more frequent
incremental steps.

The most serious drawback, however, and the one that has made me truly
reconsider the whole setup, is fairly recent, and caused by the fact that
there are now so many different editions of Terry's books available that
the percentage of readers to whom *either* of the page numbers I supply
means anything useful, is shrinking, and will only get smaller over time.
Not only do we now have American editions in widespread use, but we also
have reissues of the older Corgi paperbacks and Gollancz hardcovers, both
with page counts that are different from the original versions.

Finally, I think the most useful aspects of the page numbers is that they
provide an ordering of the list of annotations for a given book. Had Terry
written in chapters, I probably would never have used page numbers at all,
but merely listed the annotations on a per-chapter basis. I strongly
suspect that the actual page numbers are used more often by me as editor
than by the vast majority of APF readers. I doubt that the APF readers
often have a need to use the page numbers as a link back from individual
annotations to the source text. Rather, it will be the other way around,
and on a much more global level: "I have just read "Pyramids_", now I'll go
browse through the annotations for that book and see what I've missed".

With all that in mind I have decided that the APF will be switching to
uni-numbered annotations, based on the editions of the books I happen to
have in my possession. For v9.0, the double page numbers are still present
for the older books, but removing them will be one of the first things on
the TODO list for v10.0.


To Annotate Or Not To Annotate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the early years of the APF nearly every annotation that I received was
quickly incorporated into the next version of the file. For the later
versions, I became a bit more selective and started rejecting as well as
accepting annotations.

For one thing, quite a few annotations didn't make it into this version of
the APF because I simply couldn't place them. People send me annotations
that are keyed to the page numbers in their books, which more often than
not are not the same editions I use, or they don't mention page numbers at
all. As a result, I sometimes have to spend a lot of time searching for a
particular sentence or scene, and in many cases I just can't place it at
all.

Another reason why annotations may be rejected is because I couldn't
confirm the reference. Mind you, sometimes I'll include references that are
simply so cool, or so authoritative-sounding, that even though I don't know
anything about the subject myself, I feel they will enhance the file.
However, I often receive annotations that are rather vague and
non-specific, and which I do not wish to include without some further
confirmation. This confirmation can for instance consist of someone else
mailing me the same annotation, or of me delving into encyclopedias or
dictionaries and checking things myself.

And a final batch of entries are of course rejected because I thought they
were either too implausible or too 'obvious'. Now note that these are not
fixed properties, and that as soon as I start getting the same annotation
from multiple sources, I will nearly always accept it for the APF,
regardless of what I may think about it myself.

However, as long I have received a particular annotation from one source
only I'm going to have to make what is basically a very subjective
judgement call – that is what editors are for. If an annotation strikes me
as implausible or just not very interesting, then it's out. If I think it's
valid, or if I just *like* it, then it's in. If a trivial annotation is in
the same category as many others already in the file, then it will usually
be in (I am a stickler for consistency), unless I'm bored, in which case I
simply want to get on with the fun stuff, and I leave it out. Sic Biscuitas
Desintegrat, as they say.

The important point I want to get across here is that none of these
annotations are rejected permanently, and that everything is filed away for
future reference. They may very well be used in later versions of the APF.

So what *do* I base my judgement calls on? The answer is of course that I
don't really consciously know, and that it usually just depends on my mood
anyway. One important rule of thumb that I try to follow as much as
possible is the following:

I do not like explaining English puns or words. As soon as another language
is involved ("with milk?") – fine. As soon as some weird old British
saying is referenced ("good fences") – cool. As soon as it is obvious that
many readers are simply not getting something that *I* consider obvious
("echognomics") – no problem. But as a basic heuristic I am assuming that
everybody who is able to read Terry Pratchett's books in the original
language has enough command of the English language to understand basic
puns, and enough sense to use a dictionary if they encounter an unfamiliar
word. I don't want to have to explain why "`Equal Rites`_" is a funny title.


The APF In Other Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the APF is available in three main formats: as a text file, as a
typeset PDF/PostScript file, and as an on-line collection of HTML web
pages.

The recommended point of entry for obtaining all these formats remains the
APF section of the L-Space Web at http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/.


Third-party Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over the years, a number of non-APF collections of Discworld annotations
have appeared (mostly on the Web), partially in reaction to the APF going
without updates for so long.

`The L-Space Wiki`_ collects annotations in a collaborative Wiki environment.
Annotations submitted to this Wiki may eventually end up incorporated in a
future version of the APF.

`Bugarup University`_ specifically collects 'Australian' annotations for "`The
Last Continent`_".

`Google Groups`_ is not a dedicated web site, but a Usenet search engine that
offers a very good way to seek out annotation discussions that have appeared on
the Pratchett newsgroups.

If you know of any other annotation sites or sources, let me know, and I
will add them to the list.

Bibliography
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section I want to list some of the specific resources I use in
editing the APF: reference works, web sites, software, etcetera.

A more exhaustive list will have to wait until one of the future updates to
the APF, but for v9.0 there are a few really heavily-used resources I want
to mention:

1. `The Complete Works of William Shakespeare`_, operated by The Tech at MIT.

   The oldest on-line Shakespeare website in existence. All Shakespeare quotes
   in the APF are taken from (and in the Web version linked to) this site.

2. `Bible Gateway`_, operated by Gospel Communications International.

   Another web site that goes back to 1993. It is an unsurpassed resource for
   scriptural research, and all Bible quotes in the APF are taken from (and in
   the Web version linked to) the King James Version available on this site.

3. `The Internet Movie Database`_, operated by Internet Movie Database, Inc.

   Another dinosaur resource that has been around since the early nineties.
   Much of the movie-related data in the APF is taken from (and in the Web
   version linked to) the IMDB.

4. `Wikipedia – The Free Encyclopedia`_, operated by Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.

   A relative newcomer among the APF editing resources, but a very important
   one. The Wikipedia articles have been invaluable in providing and checking
   the facts and definitions that make up so much of the APF.

   I have tried to keep my usage of the Wikipedia material at the level of
   'fair use'. Although in many cases I would have liked to use much more
   direct cutting-and-pasting of Wikipedia information, I cannot do this yet
   because I am not sure if this is allowed, copyright-wise. Wikipedia
   information is available under a so-called Free Documentation License,
   which allows unlimited use and modification but only under one condition:
   that the APF would in turn be released under a similar license, and I am
   not sure I can do that yet – see also the 'Copyright Discussion' section.

Copying The APF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's really quite simple: I have by now spent *very* considerable amounts
of time trying to make this document a useful resource for fans of Terry
Pratchett's work, and I would be delighted to see the APF reach as many of
those fans as possible.

Please feel free to distribute the text and PDF/PostScript versions of the
APF to others by mail or in print, and to put them up on bulletin boards,
archive sites or whatever other advanced means of communication you have
available to you.

All I ask is that you (a) always distribute the APF for free, and in its
entirety (for obvious reasons, I should hope), and (b) always include
information telling people where they can find the original version (and
possible updates) of the file (i.e. <http://www.lspace.org/>).

I'd also prefer it if you did not put up separate copies of the HTML
version of the APF on the World Wide Web (local copies for personal use are
just fine). Experience has shown that on-line copies always become outdated
very soon, but continue to foul up search engine results for other people
for ages onwards. Please just link to the canonical version of the APF on
the Web instead (again: <http://www.lspace.org/>).

If you want to translate a version of the APF into another language (or
otherwise distribute a modified version of the APF), please first contact
me at apf@lspace.org, and I will give you more information in email.


Copyright Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Formally speaking, the APF copyright situation is a bit murky. I would love
to release the APF under some form of open document license, which would
basically formalise the fact that everybody is allowed to copy and modify
the APF as they see fit. Such a license would also be a prerequisite for
being allowed to make more intensive use of other free resources such as
the **Wikipedia** free encyclopedia.

However, with the APF containing so much quoted and contributed material it
is not clear to me if I actually have the right to release the APF under an
open license. Terry has, for instance, given me permission to use excerpts
from his Usenet articles in the APF, but he is able to do that because the
copyright resides with him in the first place. I surely cannot (and even if
I could might not *want* to) release his words under a license that would
explicitly allow people to modify those words.

Similarly, although the vast majority of people have contributed
annotations to the APF with the full knowledge that their words might be
copied verbatim or edited beyond recognition, no formal copyright transfer
has ever been part of the deal. An open license would also make it possible
for people to e.g. actually start trying to sell printed copies of the APF
– and *that* might in turn be something an original submitter would not
like at all, and could lead to complaints or ill feelings.

It is for this same reason that my own project of selling printed versions
of the APF for charity never came to anything. Although at one point I
already had Terry's permission to go ahead, in the end I felt that adding
the concept of 'money' into the equation, even for charity, would generate
too much potential for problems. Better to just keep everything absolutely
non-profit.

This turned out to have been a very good decision when in 1997 we received
a cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer who claimed that we had violated
his copyright by quoting parts of the poem 'Desiderata' in one of the
annotations, and could we please tell him how much money we had made off of
it, so that he could estimate the damages he was going to sue us for. We
told him no money had ever been involved in the APF, we removed the poem,
and we never heard from him again. Now I dare say that this was just a
"can't hurt to try" approach intended to scare us (and everybody else his
search engine threw up) into settling; if he had really sued us I am fairly
certain we would been able to claim fair-use successfully. But the point is
that nobody wanted the hassle, that it would have inevitably jeopardised
our relationship with the Universities and ISPs who have been hosting the
Pratchett Archive and L-Space Web mirrors for free. And did I mention we
could do without the hassle?

I will continue to think about the copyright situation for the APF, and it
is entirely possible that in a future version some kind of formal license
will appear. Until then, I merely claim the editorial copyright on the APF
on behalf of Mike Kew and myself as editors, and I request that everyone
abide with the informal requests and restrictions outlined in the previous
section, "`Copying the APF`_".
