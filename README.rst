APF in reStructuredText
***********************

`Annotated Pratchett File`_ is an effort by Leo Breebaart with help of Mike Kew
and lots of Terry Pratchett fans to create comprehensive list of Discworld (and
other Pratchett works) trivia, annotations, joke explanations etc. It is
available in various formats, including plain text one, but quite strangely
formatted and quite hard to convert in other formats (like ebook ones, for
example: EPUB, MOBI etc). This was the reason for me to convert plain text
version to reStructuredText_ (or *rST* for short), which is is one of the best
(or just *the best*) lightweight markup language. You can convert it to HTML,
LaTeX, PDF, ODT, EPUB and most probably lots of other formats, whichever
tickles your fancy most.
