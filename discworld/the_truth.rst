The Truth
~~~~~~~~~

+ [p. 11] "Then the two watchmen trailed through the slush and muck to the
  Water Gate, [...]"

  Pin and Tulip enter Ankh-Morpork via the Water Gate, which is oddly
  appropriate, considering both Gaspode's later pseudonym (see the
  annotation for p. 190) and the name of the organisation that hires Pin
  and Tulip (see the annotation for p. 68).

+ [p. 13] "'I could've done all right with the Fung Shooey, though.'"

  Feng Shui is the ancient Chinese design philosophy in which the
  positioning and physical characteristics of the items within a residence
  are believed to affect the fortunes of the owner.

+ [p. 15] "Two men were bent over the oars."

  The characters of Pin and Tulip are somewhat frustrating for Terry in the
  sense that many, many people feel that they are 'obviously' based on Mr
  Croup and Mr Vandemar in Neil Gaiman's **Neverwhere** (who refer to
  themselves as the Old Firm, and call each other 'Mr'). Or 'obviously'
  based on the thugs Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega from the 1994 movie
  **Pulp Fiction** (and there are a good number of **Pulp Fiction** references
  in "`The Truth`_"). Or obviously based on Mr Wint and Mr Kidd from the James
  Bond movie **Diamonds are Forever**. Or obviously based on the two Rons
  (who called themselves 'The Management') from the BBC **Hale and Pace**
  series. Or...

  Terry himself had this to say:

  "1. The term 'The Old Firm' certainly wasn't invented by Neil. I think it
  first turned up amongst bookies, but I've even seen the Kray Brothers
  referred to that way. Since the sixties at least the 'the firm' has
  tended to mean 'criminal gang.' And, indeed, the term turned up in DW
  long before **Neverwhere**.

  2. Fiction and movies are full of pairs of bad guys that pretty much
  equate to Pin and Tulip. They go back a long way. That's why I used 'em,
  and probably why Neil did too. You can have a trio of bad guys (who fill
  roles that can be abbreviated to 'the big thick one, the little scrawny
  one and The Boss') but the dynamic is different. With two guys, one can
  always explain the plot to the other..."

  "A point worth mentioning, ref other threads I've seen: Hale and Pace's
  'Ron and Ron' worked precisely because people already knew the
  archetype."

+ [p. 19] "'Are you Gunilla Goodmountain?'"

  Goodmountain -> Gutenberg. Johann Gutenberg is the German (claimed)
  inventor of movable type in the 1450s, most famously responsible for the
  Gutenberg Bibles.

+ [p. 19] "'Just give me a ninety-six-point lower-case h, will you,
  Caslong? Thank you,'"

  Caslon is a well-known typeface named after its creator William Caslon,
  who released it in the 1730s. It was a highly successful and popular
  typeface throughout Europe and America: the first printings of the
  American Declaration of Independence and Constitution were set in Caslon.
  See also the annotations for p. 47 and p. 160.

+ [p. 22] "'We are a bodyguard of lies, gentlemen.'".

  Winston Churchill said "In war-time, truth is so precious that she should
  always be attended by a bodyguard of lies". Any book called **The Truth**
  should therefore have one.

+ [p. 27] "And then there had been the war against Klatch..."

  The story of this particular war has been told in great detail in
  "Jingo_".

+ [p. 29] "'M-a-k-e-$-$-$-I-n-n-Y-o-u-r-e-S-p-a-r-e-T-y-m--' he murmured."

  A development of the chain letter, 'Make money fast'-pyramid schemes
  (often literally with that title, and with the '$$$' spelling) formed a
  major part of the first waves of Internet spam (or unsolicited bulk
  messages).

+ [p. 34] "'Have you heard of c-commerce?'"

  C-commerce resonates with e-commerce, or doing business electronically,
  e.g. over the Internet.

+ [p. 35] "'A thousand years ago we thought the world was a bowl,' he said.
  'Five hundred years ago we knew it was a globe. Today we know it is flat
  and round and carried through space on the back of a turtle.' He turned
  and gave the High Priest another smile. 'Don't you wonder what shape it
  will turn out to be tomorrow?'"

  In the 1997 movie **Men in Black**, Tommy Lee Jones' character says: "1500
  years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was the centre of the universe.
  500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was flat. And 15 minutes
  ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll
  know... tomorrow."

+ [p. 40] "For that matter, what would it do to the pie?"

  As well as referring to the cooking in the previous sentence, this also
  refers to Printer Pie, a term for jumbled-up type, which will be sorted
  for the next job or recast into new type – very much in context.

+ [p. 41] "[...] that Holy Wood moving picture fiasco a few years ago..."

  This fiasco is detailed in "`Moving Pictures`_".

+ [p. 41] "[...] that Music with Rocks In business a few years after..."

  And this story is told in "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 41] "'[...] when the late Mr Hong chose to open his Three Jolly Luck
  Take-Away Fish Bar in Dagon Street during the lunar eclipse.'"

  An H. P. Lovecraft reference. See also the annotation for p. 197/149 of
  "`Men at Arms`_".

+ [p. 47] "Boddony, who seemed to be second in command of the print room,
  [...]"

  Another very aptly named dwarf: Bodoni is a well-known typeface designed
  at the end of the eighteenth century by Italian printer Giambattista
  Bodoni, who became the director of the press for the Duke of Parma, and
  who seems to have a reputation for elegance rather than accuracy.

+ [p. 51] "'Gottle o' geer, gottle o' geer,' said Ron mysteriously."

  A reference to the old ventriloquist "bottle of beer" routine. See the
  annotation for p. 64/62 of "Pyramids_" for a full explanation.

+ [p. 60] "The *tons* acted like society lords."

  The tons are troll heavies, the equivalent of Mafia capos or dons. But
  they are also trying to join **The Ton**, an eighteenth century term for
  leaders of fashion.

+ [p. 61] "[...] the P'gi Su dynasty?"

  'Peggy Sue' is the title of one of Buddy Holly's many hit songs.

+ [p. 68] "'And now... this meeting of the Committee to Unelect the
  Patrician is declared closed.'"

  The Watergate scandal break-in at the offices of the Democratic National
  Committee in 1972 was eventually traced back to the Committee to Re-Elect
  the President. Nixon denied any personal involvement, but tape recordings
  proved otherwise.

+ [p. 79] "'Do you know what they called a sausage-in-a-bun in Quirm?' said
  Mr Pin, [...]"

  Riffs on the famous "Quarter Pounder with Cheese" dialogue from **Pulp
  Fiction**:

      Vincent: "And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder
                with Cheese in Paris?"

      Jules:   "They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese?"

      Vincent: "No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what
                the fuck a Quarter Pounder is."

      Jules:   "Then what do they call it?"

      Vincent: "They call it a 'Royale' with cheese."

      Jules:   "A 'Royale' with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?"

      Vincent: "Well, a Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it 'le
                Big-Mac'."

+ [p. 88] "''m Rocky,' he mumbled, looking down."

  A boxing troll called Rocky, who keeps getting knocked down... It's
  really astonishing that it took Terry so long to come up with this
  particular troll name. The reference is, of course, to Sylvester
  Stallone's **Rocky** movies.

+ [p. 90] "The Truth Shall Make Ye Free"

  A famous bible quote, from John 8:32: "And ye shall know the truth, and
  the truth shall make you free."

+ [p. 97] "'Oh? You've signed the pledge?' said Sacharissa."

  "Taking the pledge" is what one used to do when joining Alcoholics
  Anonymous (or any other temperance movement / Methodist tee-total
  congregation).

+ [p. 101] "[...] lies could run round the world before the truth could get
  its boots on."

  A saying attributed to Mark Twain, as well as to James Watt, the Scottish
  inventor.

+ [p. 113] "'Carpet dust got mixed in, I expect.' said Otto."

  People have been speculating that this may be a reference to various
  earlier occurrences of a similar theme (in H. P. Lovecraft's work, for
  instance), but Terry said:

  "AFP, eh? Look, some ideas are just so damn obvious no one has probably
  lifted them from *anyone*. Vampire crumbles to dust, you sweep up the
  dust, you get the vampire back – mixed up with all the cat hairs and
  breadcrumbs, maybe."

+ [p. 142] "Ankh-Morpork Inquirer"

  Equivalent to the National Enquirer in its coverage of highly inventive
  news.

+ [p. 144] "'Yeah, King of the Golden River,' said the dwarf."

  'The King of the Golden River' is a classic fairy tale written in 1842 by
  John Ruskin.

  Terry adds:

  "And let me say right now that practically everything in the career of
  Harry King is fairly based on fact (except for the trolls)."

+ [p. 147] "'A dog has got personality. Personality counts for a lot.'"

  Another **Pulp Fiction** quote from Jules: "I wouldn't go so far as to call
  a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But, a dog's got personality.
  Personality goes a long way."

+ [p. 147] "'In the history of this city, gentlemen, we have put on trial
  at various times seven pigs, a tribe of rats, four horses, one flea and a
  swarm of bees.'"

  This has many Roundworld counterparts; see also the annotation for p.
  289/262 of "`Guards! Guards!`_"

+ [p. 149] "'An' then... then I'm gonna get *medieval* on his arse.'"

  A quote from **Pulp Fiction**, spoken by Marcellus Wallace as an indication
  of his intended course of action concerning the person who had, um,
  displeased him.

  When asked why he changed the original word 'ass' to the more British
  'arse', but kept the American spelling of 'medieval', Terry replied:

  "Because I prefer it, and it's optional. But ass is a weak, sad word."

+ [p. 160] "'You get them right now, Gowdie,' snapped Boddony."

  This dwarf brings to mind Frederic William Goudy, the American type
  designer who designed several Goudy fonts, as well as Berkeley Old Style.

+ [p. 169] "'Who was that hero who was condemned to push a rock up a hill
  and every time he got it to the top it rolled down again?'"

  A reference to Sisyphus from Greek mythology. See also annotation for p.
  132/108 of "Eric_".

+ [p. 176] "'Have you still got the box it came in?' said Mr Tulip, turning
  the candlestick over and over in his hands."

  This scene spoofs the **Antiques Roadshow** type television programs, where
  people bring their old items to be identified and appraised by experts.

  When asked if the reference was deliberate, Terry said:

  "My god, I don't think I could have made it more obvious... 'You'd get
  more if you had a pair' and 'have you still got the box it came in?' and
  the piggy little gleam the owners get when they realise that it's worth a
  wad. Except on ARS the owner isn't clubbed to the ground at the end,
  which I often think is a shame."

+ [p. 188] "[...], HALF MAN HALF MOTH?"

  The "Mothman" was a large creature (man-sized, but with wings) seen by
  several people in West Virginia in the second half of the 1960s, and
  reported on extensively by the regular newspapers at the time as well as
  by the Fortean Times (see also the annotation for p. 155/99 of "`Good
  Omens`_").

+ [p. 189] "Hobson's Livery Stable"

  Clearly, Willie Hobson has built the Disc's equivalent of a multi-storey
  car park.

  This becomes especially significant (as confirmed by Terry himself) in
  light of the fact the original Watergate Deep Throat used to deliver his
  information in a... multi-storey car park.

  Also, Thomas Hobson (1544-1630) was the Cambridge stable manager after
  whom the concept of "Hobson's choice" (the appearance of giving someone a
  choice, when actually there is but a single option) was named. People
  renting horses from him would be shown all available horses, but in the
  end they always had to take the one nearest the door, so that all his
  horses were exercised.

+ [p. 190] "'You can call me... Deep Bone.'"

  Deep Bone -> Deep Throat, the named used by the Watergate informant. See
  also the annotation for p. 68.

+ [p. 210] "'[...] back in Schueschien.'"

  Schueschien -> Shoe Shine.

+ [p. 275] "'"Not A Very Nice Person At All",' she read. 'I wonder what
  kind of person would put *that* on a wallet?'"

  A person such as Jules from **Pulp Fiction** might. Only his wallet read
  *Bad Motherfucker*.

+ [p. 279] "'Let us use your "ing" presses or I'll "ing" shoot your "ing"
  head "ing" off!' she screamed."

  Very reminiscent of Honey Bunny's sudden and unexpected yelling at the
  cafe denizens in **Pulp Fiction**: "Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll
  execute every motherfuckin' last one of ya!".

+ [p. 289] "WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN THE HEART OF MEN?"

  *The Shadow Knows!*

  This question and answer made up the opening lines from one of the most
  popular radio shows in history, **Detective Story** (later quickly renamed
  to **The Shadow**).

+ [p. 296] "'Every day, in every vay, ve get better and better.'"

  "Every day, in every way, I am becoming better and better" was the mantra
  introduced as a form of auto-suggestion psychotherapy by Emile Coue in
  the 1920s.

+ [p. 310] "'Have you locked him up,' said Sacharissa suspiciously, 'in a
  deep cell, and made him wear a mask all the time [...]"

  Reference to Alexandre Dumas' 1846 novel **The Man in the Iron Mask**.
