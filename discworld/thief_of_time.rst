Thief Of Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Terry comments on the inspiration for **Thief of Time**:

  "The genesis for ToT, for me, was an article I read a few years ago about
  a genuine glass clock, with one metal component (the image of it
  shattering in slow motion tends to stick in the mind) and I believe it
  was made in Germany. The idea of a perfect clock stopping Time seemed an
  inevitable next step. This made it a 'Susan' book, because she's not a
  creature of time... which brought in Death and the Auditors, with their
  known animosity to life... and so it went."

+ [title] **Thief of Time**

  From the old saying: Procrastination is the thief of time.

+ [p. 7] "an enthusiasm for healthy sports [footnote: Mostly involving big,
  big beachballs]"

  A cliche of 50's "naturist" films was a group of women throwing around a
  large beachball.

+ [p. 7] "Tragedy loomed in the shape of thousands of tons of unaccountably
  floating iron and an exciting soundtrack..."

  A reference to the 1997 movie **Titanic**.

+ [p. 15] "There were snatches of sound, too, of laughter, tears, screams
  and for some reason a brief burst of xylophone music, which caused him to
  pause for a moment."

  Refers back to the conversation Susan had with Albert back in "`Soul
  Music`_":

       Susan:  "I mean I'm an ordinary kid!"

       Albert: "Listen, ordinary kids get a xylophone. They don't just ask
               their granddad to take his shirt off!"

+ [p. 18] "'We are Myria LeJean. *Lady* Myria LeJean.'"

  The name "Myria" resonated with the English word "myriad", meaning "a
  vast number" or "comprised of a large number of things".

  In the Bible, Mark 5, Jesus encounters a man in the country of the
  Gadarenes who is possessed by not one, but a multitude of unclean
  spirits: "And [Jesus] asked him, What is thy name? And he answered,
  saying, My name is Legion: for we are many." (Jesus allows the spirits to
  leave the man, and enter a herd of swine instead.)

  In other words (and as Susan will also explain later), Myria(d)
  LeJean/legion is a perfectly appropriate name for a large group of (evil)
  spirits controlling a human body.

+ [p. 21] "'It's Xeno's Paradox.'"

  We've encountered Xeno the philosopher and his paradoxes before, in
  "Pyramids_". See the various 'philosopher' annotations for that book.

+ [p. 21] "'**Grim Fairy Tales**?' he said."

  Reference to our world's **Grimm's Fairy Tales**, after the influential
  volumes of folk and fairy tales collected and published in the nineteenth
  century by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.

+ [p. 28] "[footnote: There may, as the philosopher says, be no spoon,
  although this begs the question of why there is the idea of soup.]"

  I don't think there has ever been a philosopher who has made
  pronouncements about spoons, but "There is no spoon" is of course one of
  the better-known metaphysical mumbo-jumbo quotes from the original **The
  Matrix** movie.

+ [p. 29] "'Master Soto sent him. You know?'"

  'Soto' is the last name of Marco Soto, who won a charity auction for the
  right to appear as a character in a Discworld novel.

+ [p. 31] "'Soto said he saw him perform the Stance of the Coyote!'"

  Echoes of the 'Crane' technique' made famous by the **The Karate Kid**
  movies. Martial Arts in general, and Kung Fu in particular, have many
  techniques and styles named after animals, e.g. 'Stance of Horse'.

  There's of course also Wile E. Coyote's 'stance' – suspended in mid-air
  for seconds before dropping into the ravine – from the Roadrunner
  cartoons.

+ [p. 35] "[...] a crowbar dropped out and onto the street with a clang."

  Later in the book (p. 138) Lobsang says building a clock that would tick
  with the universe would be impossible because "it would be like opening a
  box with the crowbar that's inside", but that's just what happens here
  because Jeremy has some help. A nice little precursor.

+ [p. 60] "The abbot had never mastered the art of circular ageing."

  Circular *breathing* is the technique of breathing in through the nose
  while simultaneously breathing out through the mouth. This allows
  musicians playing a wind instrument to hold a single note for minutes at
  a time, if necessary.

+ [p. 70] "'It is the Way of Mrs Marietta Cosmopilite, 3 Quirm Street,
  Ankh-Morpork, Rooms For Rent, Very Reasonable.'"

  We have met Mrs Marietta Cosmopilite in several previous books starting
  from "`Moving Pictures`_".

+ [p. 72] "'Word one is, you don't call me "master" and I don't name you
  after some damn insect.'"

  A reference to the 'grasshopper' nickname from the **Kung Fu** television
  series (see also the annotation for p. 165/107 of "`Good Omens`_").

+ [p. 110] "Oh, maybe fishermen would start to dredge up strange whiskery
  fish that they'd only ever seen before as fossils [...]"

  Coelacanths are the oldest living fish known to date. In 1938, a
  Coelacanth was found off the east coast of South Africa. Up to then,
  these animals were considered to have been extinct since the end of the
  Cretaceous era.

+ [p. 121] "'You've disobeyed my *baababa* orders before, though. In Omnia,
  I remember.'"

  Indeed he has. This story is told in greater detail in "`Small Gods`_".

+ [p. 124] "'Qu's having fun, I see,' said Lu-Tze."

  Qu is of course the Discworld version of Q, head of the technical branch
  of the British Secret Service in the James Bond movies, who was played by
  Desmond Llewellyn until his death in 1999.

  This entire scene is written in the style of the classic James Bond / Q
  dialogues. Terry says:

  "As I wrote it I could [hear Llewellyn's voice], too. Qu will be back –
  unlike, alas, Desmond Llewellyn."

+ [p. 124] "'Bang, instant karma!'"

  'Instant Karma!' is the title of a well-known John Lennon track.

+ [p. 130] "He found himself thinking of his new master as the tick-tock
  man."

  'Repent Harlequin! Said the Ticktock Man' is the title of a classic
  science-fiction short story by Harlan Ellison. It describes a dystopian
  society, ruled and time-regulated down to the microsecond by the Master
  Timekeeper, aka the Ticktock Man. The Timekeeper is challenged by the
  free-spirited Harlequin (who is never on time – a crime punishable by
  death in that society).

+ [p. 136] "[footnote: '*We* belong dead? Ecthcuthe me? Where doeth it thay
  "we"?']"

  From the **Bride of Frankenstein** movie. See also the annotation for p.
  305/255 of "`Moving Pictures`_".

+ [p. 150] "'Is it a book?' said one who was slightly intellectual. 'How
  many words?'"

  Reference to the game 'charades'.

+ [p. 159] "Given that she'd met the Tooth Fairy, the Soul Cake Duck and
  Old Man Trouble, it amazed Susan that she had grown up to be mostly
  human, nearly normal."

  Susan met the Tooth Fairy in "Hogfather_". For the Soul Cake Duck see the
  annotation for p. 75/57 of "`Soul Music`_", and for Old Man Trouble see the
  annotation for p. 86 of "`Feet of Clay`_".

+ [p. 188] "'Mr Black. Mr Green. Miss Brown. Miss White. Miss... Yellow.
  And Mr Blue.'"

  Reminiscent of the criminal protagonists in Quentin Tarantino's 1992
  movie **Reservoir Dogs** (Mr White, Mr Orange, Mr Blonde, Mr Pink, Mr Brown
  and Mr Blue). Note how 'Mr Blonde' maps to 'Miss... Yellow'.

+ [p. 274] "The idea was strangely attractive."

  Strange attractors are a concept from mathematics, specifically the study
  of chaos theory and dynamical systems.

+ [p. 275] "The Fifth Horseman rode out, and a faint smell of cheese
  followed him"

  The Bible, Revelation 6:7: "And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its
  rider's name was Death, and Hades followed with him".

+ [p. 283] "'"Oh, my paws and whiskers"?'"

  The White Rabbit in **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland** is always late
  (i.e. having trouble with time) and anxious: "Oh my ears and whiskers,
  how late it's getting!". See also the annotation for p. 46/35 of "`Soul
  Music`_".

+ [p. 289] "The Death of Rats had scurried up the side of the clock [...]"

  As the nursery rhyme goes:

    |   Hickory Dickory Dock,
    |   The mouse ran up the clock
    |   The clock struck one,
    |   The mouse ran down,
    |   Hickory Dickory Dock
