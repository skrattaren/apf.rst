- [title] **Eric**

  The subtitle to "Eric_" ('Faust', crossed out) already indicates what
  story is being parodied in this novella: that of the German alchemist and
  demonologist Johannes (or Georg) Faust who sold his soul to the devil.

  The most famous version of the Faust legend is perhaps the one told by
  Goethe in **Faust**, with Cristopher Marlowe's earlier play **The Tragical
  History of Dr Faustus** a close second.

- [p. 9/9] "[...] where the adventuresses Herrena the Henna-Haired
  Harridan, Red Scharron and Diome, Witch of the Night, were meeting for
  some girl talk [...]"

  Herrena is the swordswoman from "`The Light Fantastic`_" who hunted
  Rincewind, and Red Scharron is the Discworld version of Red Sonja. I
  can't place Diome, though her name sounds horribly familiar. There was a
  minor Greek goddes called Dione, and a Greek warrior called Diomedes, but
  neither of those sounds appropriate.

- [p. 27/21] The book Eric uses to summon his demon has the title
  **Mallificarum Sumpta Diabolicite Occularis Singularum**, or the Book of
  Ultimate Control. But note the initials.

  Also, the actual dog-Latin translates more or less to: "Evil-making
  Driver of the Little One-Eyed Devil".

- [p. 26/31] "In the centre of the inferno, rising majestically from a lake
  of lava substitute and with unparalleled view of the Eight Circles, lies
  the city of Pandemonium."

  The name 'Pandemonium' originates with Milton's **Paradise Lost**; it's the
  city built by Lucifer and his followers after the Fall.

- [p. 46/41] The name of the Tezumen god, 'Quetzovercoatl', puns on the
  actual Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.

  According to Aztec mythology, Quetzalcoatl was also supposed to return to
  his people at some particular future date.

- [p. 50/46] "There are quite a lot of uses to which you can put a stone
  disc with a hole in the middle, and the Tezumen had explored all but one
  of them."

  This may refer to the Aztecs (who the Tezumen are obviously modelled on
  anyway) who, according to popular legend did not know about the wheel
  either, but reputedly used small discs with holes in them for money, and
  who had a basketball-like game where the baskets were also stone discs
  with holes in them. The tale that the losers got sacrificed is probably
  untrue. But the winners were allowed to take the possession of any
  spectators they chose – no one hung around after the game in those days.

  Other sources say that it was the *winners* who got the privilege of
  being sacrificed. Oh well, whether it was losers, spectators, or winners
  – at least *somebody* got sacrificed.

- [p. 52/47] "[...] a giant-sized statue of Quetzovercoatl, the Feathered
  Boa."

  Quetzalcoatl the Aztec God was in fact portrayed as a winged serpent.
  This is almost, but not quite, the same as a feathered boa. A feather boa
  is of course also an item of women's clothing that became popular in the
  1920s.

- [p. 58/51] Ponce da Quirm, looking for the Fountain of Youth, is based on
  Ponce de Leon, the 15th century Spanish nobleman who did the same.

- [p. 81/69] "Fortunately, Rincewind was able to persuade the man that the
  future was another country."

  Reference to the opening words of **The Go-between**. See the annotation
  for p. 13/11 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 82/70] "Some talk of Alexander and some of Hercules, of Hector and
  Lysander and such great names as these."

  This is actually the opening line to the march 'The British Grenadiers',
  an English song dating back to the 17th century with about the same
  jingoism factor as 'Rule Britannia' or 'Land of Hope and Glory':

    |   Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules,
    |   Of Hector and Lysander, and such great men as these;
    |   But of all the world's brave heroes there's none that can compare
    |   With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadier.

- [p. 89/75] Lavaeolus is not only a dog-Latin translation of 'Rincewind',
  but the character is also a parody of Ulysses, tragic hero of the Trojan
  wars. It's really not necessary to annotate all the stuff about wooden
  horses and such, right? Right?

- [p. 97/81] "'It'll be fifteen choruses of 'The Ball of Philodephus' next,
  you mark my words.'"

  Refers to an old and rather obscene British drinking song called 'The
  Ball of Kerrymuir', which, according to Terry: "[...] belongs in the same
  category as 'Colonel Bogey' – everyone knows a line or two [sorry...
  everyone male and in the UK, anyway]".

  For a sample of the lyrics to this song, see the "`Song...`_" section in
  Chapter 5 of this document.

  The song's title was changed into the slightly more convincing-sounding
  'The Ball of Philodelphus' in the small-format UK paperback of "Eric_".

- [p. 99/82] "– vestal virgins, Came down from
  Heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos, And when the ball was over, There were
  –"

  From one of the more printable verses of 'The Ball of Kerrymuir' (see
  previous annotation):

    |   Four and twenty virgins
    |   Came down from Inverness,
    |   And when the ball was over
    |   There were four and twenty less

  One page later (p. 100/83) there is a final reference to the song: "--
  the village harpy she was there –"

- [p. 115/96] "'Multiple choice they call it, it's like painting the –
  painting the – painting something very big that you have to keep on
  painting, sort of thing.'"

  The British proverb this refers to is "it's like painting the Forth
  bridge". The Forth bridge can be found spanning the Forth river (no
  kidding) between the towns of North Queensferry and South Queensferry,
  just outside Edinburgh, Scotland. It is so large that when they have
  finished painting it, it is time to start over again.

  In reality, I'm told, they simply look for bits of the Forth bridge
  that need painting and paint them. So it is true that they keep on
  painting, but they do it discretely, not continuously.

  (One correspondent reports that a similar story is told about Golden
  Gate bridge being in a perpetual state of corrosion control painting,
  and it would not surprise to find other very large man-made structures
  will have given rise to their own local versions of the proverb.)

- [p. 117/97] "'Centuries [...]. Millenia. Iains.'"

  For some reason, Rincewind has problems with the word 'aeons'. See p.
  94/86 of "Sourcery_" for the first documented occurrence of this
  particular blind spot.

- [p. 121/100] "Some ancient and probably fearful warning was edged over
  the crumbling arch, but it was destined to remain unread because over it
  someone had pasted a red-and-white notice which read: 'You Don't Have To
  Be 'Damned' To Work Here, But It Helps!!!'"

  The original notice (according to Dante, in the translation by Rev.
  Francis Cary) would have been the famous: "Through me you pass into the
  city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the
  people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric moved: To rear me
  was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before
  me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure.
  All hope abandon, ye who enter here."

  The more obvious reference (included here only to stop the email from
  people who thought I missed it) is of course the cheesy legend "You Don't
  Have To Be Mad To Work Here, But It Helps!".

- [p. 121/101] "'Multiple exclamation marks [...] are a sure sign of a
  diseased mind."

  People like using this particular quip in Usenet conversations or in
  their .signatures, and every time somebody will follow-up with "hey,
  you're wrong, that's a quote from "`Reaper Man_`"!".

  The answer is of course simply that similar quotes occur in *both* books
  (in "`Reaper Man`_" it's on p. 215/189, and goes: "Five exclamation marks,
  the sure sign of an insane mind").

  Since then, "Maskerade_" has been released, which of course takes the
  concept of the insanity-defining exclamation marks to a whole new level.

- [p. 122/101] "'[...] I think it's quite possible that we're in Hell.'"

  The whole sequence in Hell is based loosely on Dante's **Inferno** (which
  in turn is based on Vergil's **Aeneid**) in much the same way the book as a
  whole is based on **Faust**. Rincewind and Eric correspond to Vergil (who
  is Dante's guide to Hell) and Dante in the same way that they are
  Mephistopheles and Faust. The various references to the geographical
  topology build on how Dante organised Hell in nine concentric circles
  (this of course had to become eight circles for the Discworld version!).
  The outer circles contained lesser sinners, such as Julius Caesar and
  Socrates, while the inner circles were reserved for mortal sinners
  (mostly Dante's political enemies; some people down there weren't dead at
  the time of publication, but got a mention anyway). At the centre, in the
  9th circle, Lucifer sits chewing away on Brutus, Crassus and Judas. If
  you climb over him you get to Purgatory, meeting Cato the younger on the
  way.

- [p. 125/103] "I mean, I heard where we're supposed to have all the *best*
  tunes,"

  Refers to the old saying "the devil has all the good tunes".

- [p. 131/107] "'[...] his punishment was to be chained to that rock and
  every day an eagle would come down and peck his liver out. Bit of an old
  favourite, that one.'"

  Most people will associate this particular punishment with Prometheus
  (who stole the secret of fire from the Gods and gave it to mankind), but
  in fact Prometheus underwent his punishment chained to a rock in the
  Caucasus (from which Hercules later freed him). The chap who had to go
  through to the same thing in the Underworld was the giant Tityus, who had
  tried to rape Leto, the mother of Artemis and Apollo. As the demon says:
  this particular punishment is a bit of an old favourite with Zeus.

- [p. 132/108] "'Man who went and defied the gods or something. Got to keep
  pushing that rock up the hill even though it rolls back all the time--'"

  Eric is thinking of king Sisyphus of Corinth, who betrayed Zeus to the
  father of the girl Aegina, whom Zeus had abducted (the girl, not the
  father).

- [p. 135/110] "'According to Ephebian mythology, there's a girl who comes
  down here every winter.'"

  In Greece she was called Persephone, daughter of Ceres, the goddess of
  agriculture. Hades abducted Persephone, imprisoned her in the underworld,
  and took her for his wife. Ceres went into mourning and there was a
  worldwide death of crops and famine. The gods negotiated a deal with
  Hades whereby he would release Persephone from the underworld, but only
  if she had eaten nothing while down there (she hadn't thus far, being too
  upset). Upon hearing of her impending release, Persephone's heart was
  gladdened, and before she could be stopped, she started eating a
  pomegranate. She spit it out, but it was found she had swallowed six
  pomegranate seeds. Hades therefore demanded that she should spend 6
  months out of each year in the underworld. During the 6 months that
  Persephone is down below, her mother, Ceres, neglects her duties and this
  causes the winter. Hence: "'I think the story says she actually *creates*
  the winter, sort of.' 'I've known women like that,' said Rincewind,
  nodding wisely."

- [p. 136/110] "'Or it helps if you've got a lyre, I think.'"

  A reference to the legend of Orpheus (see also the annotation for p.
  93/93 of "`The Light Fantastic`_"), who charmed Hades and Persephone into
  releasing Eurydice by virtue of his lyre-playing.

- [p. 153/124] "Pour encouragy le – poor encoura – to make everyone sit
  up and damn well take notice."

  "Pour encourager les autres." See the annotation for p. 114/104 of
  "`Guards! Guards!`_"
