The Streets of Ankh-Morpork
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- B4--D4 Chrononhotonthologos Street.

  **Chrononhotonthologos** is the name of an 18th century burlesque stage
  farce by Henry Carey. I have no idea why there is a Chrononhotonthologos
  Street in Ankh-Morpork â€“ except that it is one heck of a cool word.
