- [p. 5/5] The Titles of the Books

  "Pyramids_" is split into four 'Books', a structure that gives it a unique
  position amongst the otherwise chapterless Discworld novels ("`The Colour
  of Magic`_" doesn't really count – it's a collection of linked novellas,
  not a single novel with chapters or sections).

  Book I is **The Book of Going Forth**, which refers to **The Book of Going
  Forth By Day**, (see the annotation for p. 9/9 of "`The Light Fantastic`_").
  Book II is **The Book of the Dead**, a more direct reference to the
  Egyptian Book of the Dead. Book III is **The Book of the New Son** which
  puns on the title of the Gene Wolfe SF novel **The Book of the New Sun**
  (perhaps there is an earlier title both authors are drawing on, but I
  haven't been able to trace it). Book IV, finally, is **The Book of 101
  Things A Boy Can Do**, which gives a nod to the typical titles sported a
  few decades ago by books containing wholesome, innocent, practical, but
  above all *educational* activities for children.

- [p. 7/7] "[...] the only turtle ever to feature on the
  Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, [...]"

  The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram depicts the evolution of stars, plotting
  luminosity (how strongly they emit light) versus surface temperature
  (determined from their colour).

- [p. 8/8] "Some people think a giant dung beetle pushes it."

  The ancient Egyptians did, for instance.

- [p. 10/10] "Morpork was twinned with a tar pit."

  A reference to the concept of twin cities.

  Following the horrors of the Second World War, and in the spirit of
  egalitarianism and common feeling for our fellow men which prevailed at
  that time, it was decided that the best way to cement bonds between the
  people of the world so that they would never *ever* even consider
  dropping big noisy things on each other again, was to have every town,
  village and (apparently) cowshed in Europe 'twinned' with an equivalent
  one which had previously been on the other side.

  With these new-found unities, the merry laughing people of Europe would
  engage in fraternal and sporting activities, school-children would go on
  two-week exchange visits to discover that they couldn't stand sauerkraut,
  and the respective mayors of the towns would be able to present each
  other with touching and expensive symbols of international friendship and
  get in the local paper all on other peoples' money.

  The most visible effect of this accord is the presumptuous little legend
  under the sign at the entrance to towns and villages saying "Little
  Puddlebury – twinned with Obermacht am Rhein". Some towns (Croydon
  springs to mind) got a little over-enthusiastic about twinning, with the
  result that they are coupled to several towns, which makes the sign
  saying "Croydon welcomes careful drivers" look reminiscent of a
  seventeen-year-old's jacket at a Guns n' Roses concert.

  You may – or may not – care to know that the UK town of Cowes has a
  twin relation with the New Zealand township of Bulls.

- [p. 11/11] "Teppic paused alongside a particularly repulsive gargoyle
  [...] He found himself drumming his fingers on the gargoyle, [...]
  Mericet appeared in front of him, wiping grey dust off his bony face."

  It may not be immediately obvious from the text, but Mericet *was* the
  gargoyle. Teppic had been leaning on his camouflaged instructor all the
  time. This is another annotation which I am only putting in after
  repeated requests from readers. Personally, I feel that 'getting' this is
  simply a question of careful reading. But a quick straw poll of a.f.p.
  readers showed most were in favour of explicitly annotating it, so in it
  went.

  Terry was once asked at a talk if he was always fully in control of his
  characters and events or if they tended to run away with him. The answer
  was: always in control – with one single exception. The whole of the
  assassin examination sequence in "Pyramids_" was written "almost in a
  trance" with no idea of what was to happen next. It is one of his
  favourite bits.

- [p. 12/12] Teppic's test.

  Teppic's examination is heavily modelled on the British Driving test,
  which, as with the other important tests in British life such as 16- and
  18-plus exams, undergraduate finals, and doctoral vitas is not actually
  intended to test whether you are actually any *good* at what is being
  tested, concentrating instead on your proficiency at following arbitrary
  instructions.

  Many of the elements of a driving test are present in the passages which
  follow: The short list of questions, the sign on a small card (often held
  upside down), the clipboard. Mericet's rather stilted language, "Now, I
  want you to proceed at your own pace towards the Street of Book-keepers,
  obeying all signs and so forth", is almost a direct parody, as is the
  little speech at the end of the test. The 'Emergency Drop' (p. 42/42) is
  the 'Emergency Stop', where you have to stop the car "as if a child has
  run out into the road, while keeping control of the vehicle at all
  times". Finally, the back of the Highway Code has a table with minimum
  vehicle stopping distances, which examiners *almost* never ask about.

- [p. 14/14] "He [...] jumped a narrow gap on to the tiled roof of the
  Young Men's Reformed-Cultists-of-the-Ichor-God-Bel-Shamharoth Association
  gym, [...]"

  Refers our world's YMCA youth hostels. YMCA stands for 'Young Men's
  Christian Association', and is often made fun of (e.g. Monthy Python and
  their 'Young Men's Anti-Christian Association').

  See also the annotation for p. 88/88 of "`The Light Fantastic`_".

- [p. 15/15] "[...] the narrow plank bridge that led across Tinlid Alley."

  In our world, Tin Pan Alley is the popular name for the area in New York
  City near 14th Street, where many publishers of popular songs had their
  offices in the late 19th / early 20th century. Aspiring composers would
  audition their new songs, and the din of so many songs being pounded out
  of pianos up and down the street gave the district its name. Another
  theory has it that the name derived from the rattling of tins by rivals
  when a performance was too loud and too protracted.

  In England, Denmark Street, off Charing Cross Road, was also called Tin
  Pan Alley.

  Today the phrase simply refers to the music publishing industry in
  general, and it is therefore no surprise that later, in "`Soul Music`_", we
  learn that the Guild of Musicians have their headquarters there.

- [p. 17/17] "Oh, Djelibeybi had been great once, [...]"

  The name Djelibeybi puns on the sweets called Jelly Babies. See also the
  annotation for p. 109/82 of "`Soul Music`_".

  It has been remarked that there are quite a few parallels between the
  country of Djelibeybi and the castle of Gormenghast as described by
  Mervyn Peake in his **Gormenghast** trilogy (which we know Terry has read
  because in "`Equal Rites`_" he compares Unseen University to Gormenghast,
  and in "`Wyrd Sisters`_" he does the same with Lancre Castle). The hero of
  **Gormenghast**, Titus, also has a mother with a cat obsession, and his
  father died because he thought he was an owl. Furthermore, the atmosphere
  of decay, ancient history and unchanging ritual pervades both Djelibeybi
  and Gormenghast, with in both cases the presence of arbiters of tradition
  who are almost as powerful as (or even more so than) the actual ruler.

  For those interested in pursuing Gormenghast further (people who have
  read it almost invariably seem to think it's a work of genius), the names
  of the three novels are **Titus Groan** (1946), **Gormenghast** (1950) and
  **Titus Alone** (1959, revised 1970).

- [p. 19/19] "[...] the Plague of Frog."

  Refers to the Biblical 'Plague of Frogs' from Exodus.

- [p. 20/20] On the subject of the Assassin's Guild School, Terry has this
  to say: "Yes, the whole setup of the Assassin's Guild school has, uh, a
  certain resonance with Rugby School in **Tom Brown's Schooldays** (note to
  Americans: a minor Victorian classic of school literature which no-one
  reads anymore and which is probably now more famous for the first
  appearance of the Flashman character subsequently popularised by George
  MacDonald Fraser)."

  Teppic and his friends map directly to corresponding characters in **Tom
  Brown's Schooldays**: Teppic is Tom, Chidder is Harry "Scud" East, Arthur
  is George Arthur and Cheesewright is sort of Flashman, but not exactly.

  The line on p. 27/26 about "'If he invites you up for toast in his study,
  *don't go*,'" may refer to the incident where Tom is roasted in front of
  the fire by Flashy and his cronies. The reference to blanket-tossing on
  p. 45/44, which Arthur puts a stop to, is also an incident in **Tom
  Brown**, on Tom's first day. The scene in the dormitory on the first
  night, when Arthur gets down to say his prayers, also has an equivalent
  in the book.

- [p. 39/38] "'Truly, the world is the mollusc of your choice...'"

  The oyster is, of course, a mollusc.

- [p. 45/44] "[...] the day when Fliemoe and some cronies had decided
  [...]"

  Someone on a.f.p. noticed that 'Flymo' is a brand of lawnmower, and
  wondered if there was a connection. Terry replied:

  "Er. I may as well reveal this one. That section of the book is 'somewhat
  like' **Tom Brown's Schooldays**. A bully (right hand man to the famous
  Flashman) was Speedicut. Speedicut is (was?) a name for a type of
  lawnmower – I know, because I had to push the damn thing... Hence...
  Fliemoe.

  Well, it's better than mugging old ladies..."

- [p. 45/44] "It transpired that he was the son of the late Johan Ludorum
  [...]."

  At a British public school/grammar school sports day, the pupil who
  overall won the most, was declared 'Victor Ludorum' – "Winner of the
  games".

- [p. 45/45] "He could send for Ptraci, his favourite handmaiden."

  Should be pronounced with a silent 'p'. Note also that in the UK the name
  Tracey (Sharon, too) is often used to generically refer to the kind of
  girl immortalised in the "dumb blonde" jokes, or Essex Girl jokes as they
  are known in the UK.

  This annotation may also help explain why over on alt.fan.pratchett
  people regularly and affectionately refer to their Favourite Author as
  'Pterry' (although the lazier participants usually just refer to him as
  TP, conforming to the sometimes bloody annoying Usenet habit of
  acronymising everything longer than two words or four characters,
  whichever comes first. Hence DW stands for Discworld, TCOM for "`The
  Colour of Magic`_", and APF for Annotated Pratchett File – but you already
  knew that).

  I was later informed that 'Pterry' was also the name of a pterodactyl on
  a kids' TV program called **Jigsaw**, but as far as I can recall Terry's
  nickname was not coined with that in mind.

- [p. 50/49] "It's rather like smashing a sixer in conkers."

  Conkers are the nuts of the Horse Chestnut – not the one you eat, the
  other one with the really spiky outer covering. It is a regular autumn
  pass-time in England for school-boys to put conkers on the end of bits of
  string, and commence doing battle.

  The game of conkers is played by two players, almost always by challenge.
  One player holds his conker up at arms length on the end of its bit of
  string, and the other player tries to swing his one with sufficient force
  to break the other player's conker. After a swing, roles are reversed.
  Since this is a virtually solely male sport, whose participants' average
  age is about seven (although there is a bunch of nutters who regularly
  get on local news programmes with their "world championship"), there is
  of course much potential for strategic 'misses' against the opponents
  knuckles, or indeed against almost any other part of his anatomy.

  In the (rather unlikely, usually) event of one conker breaking the other
  one, the winning conker becomes a 'one-er'. A conker which has won twice,
  is a 'two-er'. Hence a 'sixer' (although it must be remembered that there
  are of course the usual collection of bogus seventeeners and
  sixty-seveners which circulate the black market of the playing field).
  There is a black art as to how to ensure that your conker becomes a sixer
  – baking very slowly in the oven overnight, is one approach, as is
  soaking for a week in vinegar. Most of these methods tend to make the
  conkers, if anything, more rather than less brittle. There's probably a
  lesson for us all in there somewhere.

- [p. 50/49] The legend of Ankh-Morpork being founded by two orphaned
  brothers who had been found and suckled by a hippopotamus refers to the
  legend of Romulus and Remus who were two orphaned brothers raised by a
  wolf, who later went on to found Rome (the brothers did, not the wolf).

- [p. 58/56] "Hoot Koomi, high priest of Khefin [...] stepped forward."

  The name Koot Hoomi (or Kuthhumi) is a Sanskrit word that means
  'teacher'.

  Koot Hoomi is the author of a series of letters that were published as
  **The Mahatma Letters To A. P. Sinnett**, and which form the basis of many
  theosophical teachings.

- [p. 63/62] "'Look, master Dil,' said Gern, [...]"

  Since not everyone is familiar with all those weird English food items,
  this is probably a good place to point out that there is a red line that
  runs from 'Dil the Embalmer' to 'Dill the Pickler' to 'dill pickle', a
  British delicacy.

- [p. 64/62] "'Get it? Your name in lights, see?'".

  "Your name in lights" is generally a term indicative of achieved fame and
  success. In this context, however, not everybody may be aware that
  'lights' is also a word originally describing the lungs of sheep, pigs,
  etc., but more generally used for all kinds of internal organs.
  Presumably Gern has taken various parts of the dead king and spelt out
  Dil's name.

- [p. 64/62] "'[...] I didn't think much of the Gottle of Geer routine,
  either.'"

  Ventriloquists who want to demonstrate their skill will include the
  phrase "bottle of beer" as part of their patter. However, as it is
  impossible to pronounce the 'B' without moving your lips, it usually
  comes out as "gottle of geer". Gern has presumably been playing macabre
  ventriloquism games with the corpse.

- [p. 64/63] "'Good big sinuses, which is what I always look for in a
  king.'"

  In the process of embalming, the Egyptians removed the deceased's brain
  through the nose cavity. That's all I know about the process, and if it's
  all right with you people I'd rather keep it that way.

- [p. 71/69] "'Do I really have to wear this gold mask?'"

  Terry has confirmed that the scenes in which Dios dresses up Teppic in
  his King's outfit (starting with the Flail of Mercy and culminating in
  the Cabbage of Vegetative Increase) are a parody of the old BBC
  children's game show **Crackerjack**. In this show the contestants were
  asked questions, and for each correct answer they received a prize, which
  they had to hold on to. If they answered wrong, they were given a large
  cabbage, increasing the likelihood of dropping everything. The person
  left at the end who hadn't dropped anything won the game.

- [p. 73/71] "'Interfamilial marriage is a proud tradition of our lineage,'
  said Dios."

  Teppic is astonished to hear that his great-great-grandmother once
  declared herself male as a matter of political expediency. It was in fact
  indeed the custom of the Egyptians to marry their pharaohs to close
  relatives, and Hatshepsut, daughter of Thutmose I, wife and half-sister
  of Thutmose II, and mother-in-law of Thutmose III actually did proclaim
  herself king in order to seize the throne.

  Incidentally, Dios is using the wrong word here: A marriage between
  relatives would be *intra*\familial, not *inter*\familial.

- [p. 90/87] "'This thing could put an edge on a rolling pin.'"

  See the annotation for p. 35/35 of "`The Light Fantastic`_". There's another
  more explicit reference on p. 140/134: "[...] contrary to popular opinion
  pyramids don't sharpen razor blades".

- [p. 95/91] "'Squiggle, constipated eagle, wiggly line, hippo's bottom,
  squiggle' [...] the Sun God Teppic had Plumbing Installed and Scorned the
  Pillows of his Forebears."

  The constipated eagle is obviously the plumbing system, but what not many
  people outside Britain will realise is that the hippo's bottom comes from
  an advert for Slumberdown beds, which featured a hippo sitting down next
  to a chick.

- [p. 95/92] Pteppic's dream about the seven fat and seven thin cows is a
  reference to the Bible's Joseph, who had to explain a similar dream
  (which did not have the bit about the trombone, though), to the Pharaoh.
  "Pyramids_" is of course riddled with religious references, most of which
  are too obvious or too vague to warrant inclusion here.

- [p. 100/97] "All things are defined by names. Change the name, and you
  change the thing."

  This is a very ancient concept in magic and 'primitive' religions.
  Although I haven't asked him, I'm willing to bet money that Terry did
  *not* take his inspiration from Ursula Le Guin's **A Wizard of Earthsea**,
  despite the many emails I have received suggesting a connection.

  For a definitive reference on this subject, read James George Frazer's
  **The Golden Bough**.

- [p. 102/99] "[...] I am a stranger in a familiar land."

  The phrase "stranger in a strange land" originates from the Bible, Exodus
  2:22, "And she bare [Moses] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
  said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."

  Since the "strange land" in question was Egypt, there's a nice resonance
  with "Pyramids_" itself in Terry's use of the phrase.

  These days, people may be more familiar with the quote as the title of
  Robert Heinlein's 60s cult science fiction book.

- [p. 109/105] "'*Doppelgangs*,' he said."

  Pun on the German word 'doppelgaenger', meaning 'body double'. Thanks to
  dozens of bad sf-movies the word has entered the English language in the
  mostly sinister meaning of some metamorphic life form taking the shape of
  a human being.

- [p. 127/121] Notice the sound accompanying the pyramid flares. It
  phonetically spells 'Cheops'.

- [p. 134/128] "It seemed to Teppic that its very weight was deforming the
  shape of things, stretching the kingdom like a lead ball on a rubber
  sheet."

  This metaphor ties in neatly with the quantum aspects of the Pyramids:
  rubber sheets distorted by balls are one popular way of visualising
  Einstein's general theory of relativity. The sheet represents the
  space-time-continuum, and the balls are bits of mass (like suns and
  planets). The balls press down and deform the space around them. When
  things try to move along the rubber sheet, not only are they attracted
  into the dimples in the sheet (gravity), but things like light which try
  to travel in a straight line find little kinks in their path around an
  object.

- [p. 144/138] "'She can play the dulcimer,' said the ghost of Teppicymon
  XXVII, apropos of nothing much."

  Reference to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's **Kubla Khan**. See also the
  annotation for p. 127/115 of "Sourcery_".

- [p. 156/150] "[...] distilling the testicles of a small tree-dwelling
  species of bear with the vomit of a whale, [...]"

  Animal substances are extensively used as fixatives in perfume. Examples
  include musk (from deer-testicles; 'musk' is Sanskrit for 'scrotum'),
  ambergris (from the intestines of whales) and castor (from a beaver's
  perineal gland).

- [p. 157/150] "...Phi * 1700[u/v]. Lateral e/v. Equals a tranche of seven
  to twelve..."

  Some confusion has arisen here, because the asterisk symbol '*' is the
  same one used in at least some of the editions of "Pyramids_" as a
  footnote marker. This has caused a few people to wonder if there's a
  'missing footnote' intended for this page. Matters are not helped much by
  the fact that the American paperback edition *does* contain the text of a
  footnote on (their equivalent of) p. 157/150. This footnote is simply
  misplaced and the marker for it occurs on the *previous* page (see also
  previous annotation).

  We'll let Terry have the last word in order to remove any remaining
  doubt: "I'm pretty sure the missing footnote in Pyramids doesn't exist.
  If it's what I'm thinking of, we just bunged in loads of gibberish maths
  and among the symbols was, yes, '*'."

  I am told that in later paperback editions the asterisk in question has
  been entirely removed from the text.

- [p. 168/162] "'I've got as far as "Goblins Picnic" in Book I.'"

  After the children's song called "Teddy Bears' Picnic":

    |   If you go down to the woods today
    |   You're sure of a big surprise
    |   If you go down to the woods today
    |   You'd better go in disguise
    |   For ev'ry bear that ever there was
    |   Will gather there for certain, because
    |   Today's the day the Teddy Bears have their picnic.

- [p. 176/169] The philosophers shooting arrows at tortoises are discussing
  one of Zeno's three motion paradoxes. See also Douglas Hofstadter's
  **Goedel, Escher, Bach**. Or Zeno.

- [p. 178/171] "The rest of them die of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,
  [...]"

  Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (HUP) says that for a quantum particle
  (e.g. an electron), it is impossible to know with complete accuracy both
  where it is and how fast it is going. The act of observing it interferes
  with the event you want to measure (in fact, one might say that at the
  quantum level the observation *is* the event) in such a way that it is
  physically impossible to determine both velocity and position of the
  particle in question.

- [p. 179/171] Philosophers' names.

  Xeno refers to Zeno, of aforementioned paradox. Copolymer ("the greatest
  storyteller in the history of the world") might refer to both Homer
  (because of the name) and Herodotus, 'the father of history', who was
  known for his very chatty and discursive style, and who basically made
  his living as a story-teller/dinner guest. Pthagonal ("a very acute man
  with an angle") refers to Pythagoras. Iesope ("the greatest teller of
  fables") to Aesop. Antiphon ("the greatest writer of comic plays") to
  Aristophanes. And Ibid (whose name reminds us of Ovid) is actually short
  for ibidem, which means, when citing literature references: 'same author
  as before'. Hence the quip later on: "Ibid you already know".

  The only one left is Endos the Listener, who is perhaps meant to portray
  the standard second-man-in-a-Socratic-dialogue – the man who spends the
  entire dialogue saying things like "That is correct, Socrates", "I
  agree", "you're right", "your reasoning appears correct", and the like.

  Also, an 'antiphon' is a name for a versicle or sentence sung by one
  choir in response to another (e.g.: "No you can't / Yes I can!" repeated
  many times with rising pitch. Or a more modern example would perhaps be
  Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody': "No, we will not let you go / Let me go!").
  'Copolymer' is a term from chemistry; it refers to a polymer (plastic)
  made from more than one kind of monomer (simple compound).

  [ Finally, my source also suspects that Copolymer's monologue may be a
  take-off on a particular translation of his **Histories**. Anybody? ]

- [p. 179/172] "'The tortoise *did* beat the hare,' said Xeno sulkily."

  Reference to Aesop's classic fable **The Hare and the Tortoise**.

  If you have access to the Internet, you can find an online version of the
  Aesop fables at the URL:

  <ftp://ftp.uu.net/doc/literary/obi/Aesop/Fables.Z>

- [p. 180/173] "Now their gods existed. They had, as it were, the complete
  Set."

  For those of you whose Egyptian mythology is a little rusty: Set, brother
  to Isis and Osiris and father of Anubis, was the Egyptian God of evil and
  darkness.

- [p. 181/174] "'Sacrifice a chicken under his nose.'"

  Refers to the old practice of burning a feather under the nose of an
  unconscious or fainted person.

- [p. 181/174] "'[...] here comes Scarab again... yes, he's gaining
  height... Jeht hasn't seen him yet, [...].'"

  The high priest's commentary on the gods' battle for the sun is obviously
  based on sports commentators. In particular, several of the phrases are
  based on the diction of David Coleman, a popular British figure of fun
  noted for his somewhat loose grasp on reality and his tendency towards
  redundancy and solecism. In fact, an amusingly redundant comment spoken
  live by a personality is sometimes referred to as a 'Colemanball', after
  the column of that name in the satirical magazine **Private Eye**.

  Typical Colemanballs include, "...He's a real fighter, this lad, who
  believes that football's a game of two halves, and that it isn't over
  until the final whistle blows", or during the test (cricket) matches,
  "And he's coming up to bowl now... The bowler's Holding, the batsman's
  Willey...". (That last one wasn't even by David Coleman, but still
  qualifies as a Colemanball).

- [p. 197/189] "'Symposium' meant a knife-and-fork tea."

  Etymologically, a symposium is indeed a "get-together for a drink". Since
  the Greeks believed in lubricating intellectual discussion with drink,
  the term eventually came to be used for a meeting which combined elements
  of partying and intellectual interchange.

- [p. 197/189] The Tsortean wars refer to the Trojan wars. (Read also
  "Eric_". Or Homer.)

- [p. 201/193] "A philosopher had averred that although truth was beauty,
  beauty was not necessarily truth, and a fight was breaking out."

  A famous quotation from John Keats' 'Ode on a Grecian Urn':

    |   'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all
    |   Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

- [p. 204/195] "[...] ships called the **Marie Celeste**, [...]"

  The **Marie Celeste** left port in 1872 with a full crew, but was later
  found (by the crew of the **Dei Gratia**), abandoned on the open sea, with
  no crew, the single lifeboat missing, and half-eaten meals in the mess
  hall. It was later discovered that captain Morehouse of the **Dei Gratia**
  had dined with the captain of the **Celeste** the night before she sailed,
  and Morehouse and his crew were eventually tried for murder, but
  acquitted because there was no hard evidence. The missing crewmen were
  never found.

- [p. 205/197] "And one of them had reputedly turned himself into a golden
  shower in pursuit of his intended."

  According to Greek mythology the beautiful Danae had been locked away in
  a dungeon by her father (King Acrisius of Argos) because a prophecy had
  foretold that his grandson would slay him. But Zeus, King of the Gods,
  came upon Danae in a shower of gold, and fathered Perseus upon her.

+ [p. 221] "[...] every camel knew what two bricks added up to."

  In jokes, the castration (or, as the punchline dictates, speeding up)
  of camels is achieved by taking two bricks and smashing the animal's
  testicles between them.

- [p. 250/239] "'Go, tell the Ephebians –' he began."

  This is a paraphrase of "Go tell the Spartans", which is the beginning of
  the memorial for the Spartan soldiers who got massacred by the Persians
  at Thermopylae as a result of Greek treachery. The full quote is given by
  Simonides (5th century BC) as:

    |   Go, tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,
    |   That here obedient to their laws we lie

- [p. 270/259] "And it was while he was staring vaguely ahead, [...] that
  there was a faint pop in the air and an entire river valley opened up in
  front of him."

  People interested in more stories about magically disappearing valleys
  are referred to R. A. Lafferty's 'Narrow Valley' (to be found in his
  collection **Nine Hundred Grandmothers**), where a half a mile wide valley
  is sorcerously narrowed (with its inhabitants) to a few feet and then
  opened up again by the end of the story.

- [p. 271/259] "[...] the birds said more with a simple bowel movement than
  Ozymandias ever managed to say."

  Ozymandias was the Greek name for Ramses the Second. Percy Bysshe
  Shelley's poem **Ozymandias** is famous, but because it is short and it has
  always been a favourite of mine I hope you will forgive me the indulgence
  of reproducing it here in full:

    |   I met a traveler from an antique land
    |   Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
    |   Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
    |   Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
    |   And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
    |   Tell that their sculptor well those passions read
    |   Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
    |   The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;
    |   And on the pedestal these words appear:
    |   'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
    |   Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
    |   Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
    |   Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
    |   The lone and level sands stretch far away."

  While I was browsing the net in order to find an on-line copy of
  **Ozymandias** so that I could cut-and-paste the text, I came across a
  wonderful piece of related information. It appears that in 1817 Shelley
  held a sonnet-writing session with his friend, the poet Horace Smith.
  Both wrote a sonnet on the same subject, but while Shelley came up with
  the aforementioned **Ozymandias**, Mr Smith produced something so
  delightfully horrendous I simply have to indulge even further, and
  include it here as well. By now the connection to our original annotation
  has been completely lost, but I think you might agree with me that
  Smith's poem would be worthy of Creosote:

        On a Stupendous Leg of Granite, Discovered Standing by Itself in
        the Deserts of Egypt, with the Inscription Inserted Below.

    |   In Egypt's sandy silence, all alone,
    |   Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws
    |   The only shadow that the Desert knows.
    |   "I am great Ozymandias," saith the stone,
    |   "The King of kings: this mighty city shows
    |   The wonders of my hand." The city's gone!
    |   Naught but the leg remaining to disclose
    |   The sight of that forgotten Babylon.
    |   We wonder, and some hunter may express
    |   Wonder like ours, when through the wilderness
    |   Where London stood, holding the wolf in chase,
    |   He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess
    |   What wonderful, but unrecorded, race
    |   Once dwelt in that annihilated place.

  The poem was cited by Guy Davenport of the University of Kentucky in a
  New York Times article a few years ago, which concluded: "Genius may also
  be knowing how to title a poem."

  whoever,' said Chidder."

  Legend has it that Cleopatra had herself smuggled to Caesar inside an
  oriental rug.
