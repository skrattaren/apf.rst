Feet of Clay
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ [title] **Feet of Clay**

  The original working title for this book was **Words in the Head**.

  "Feet of Clay" is a biblical reference. The Babylonian king
  Nebuchadnezzar had a dream in which he saw a statue whose head was made
  of gold, but lower down the statue the materials got progressively more
  base, until the feet were "part of iron, part of clay"; the statue was
  shattered and destroyed by being struck on the feet, its weakest point.
  Hence, colloquially, the expression "feet of clay" has come to mean that
  someone regarded as an idol has a hidden weakness.

+ [frontispiece] The mottoes and crests are mostly explained in the book,
  but for completeness they are:

        Edward St John de Nobbes: "capite omnia" – "take it all"

        Gerhardt Sock (butcher): "futurus meus est in visceris" – "my
          future is in the entrails"

        Vetinari: "si non confectus non reficiat" – "if it ain't broke,
          don't fix it" (a saying popularised by Lyndon B Johnson,
          though possibly older)

        Assassins Guild: "nil mortifice sine lucre" – "no killing
          without payment"

        Rudolph Potts (baker): "quod subigo farinam" – "because I knead
          the dough"

        Thieves' Guild: "acutus id verberat" – "sharp's the word"

        Vimes family: "protego et servio" – "I protect and serve". In the
          centre of the crest is the number 177, which – we learnt in "`Men
          at Arms`_" – is Vimes' own badge number.

+ [p. 7] "WE HEAR YOU WANT A GOLEM."

  The font used by the golems in the UK editions is clearly designed to
  look like Hebrew lettering. For some reason, the font used in the
  American editions is not.

  The golem itself is a creature from Jewish mythology, a man made of clay
  and animated by Kabbalistic magic. The one thing it cannot do is speak,
  because only God can grant the power of speech. There is a brief summary
  of the legend at <http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/6960/golem.htm>

+ [p. 8] "'Yeah, right, but you hear stories ... Going mad and making
  too many things, and that.'"

  One episode in the life of the golem of Prague – the best known of the
  mythical creatures – tells that the golem was ordered to fetch water,
  but never told to stop, thus causing a flood. This is very similar to
  (and may be borrowed from) the classic children's story **The Sorcerer's
  Apprentice** (**Der Zauberlehrling**, a German poem by Goethe), also used in
  Disney's classic animated film **Fantasia**. A spell used to animate a
  broom to speed housework gets out of control, leading to a frightening
  procession of hundreds of brooms bringing water from the well. The French
  composer Paul Dukas based the music on Goethe's poem. A more direct
  reference appears on p. 99, and elsewhere as a sort of running joke.

+ [p. 17] "[...], he says Mrs Colon wants him to buy a farm, [...]"

  'Buy the farm' is military slang for 'die'

+ [p. 17] "[...] I am sure I have told you about the Cable Street
  Particulars, [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 247 of "Maskerade_".

+ [p. 19] "I AM DEATH, NOT TAXES."

  It is said (after Benjamin Franklin) that in life only two things are
  certain: Death and taxes. However, the line before this kicks off a
  running gag that demonstrates than this is really one certainty too many.

+ [p. 22] "'Cheery, eh? Good to see the old naming traditions kept up.'"

  'Cheery' would fit in very well with the names of the Seven Dwarfs in the
  Disney Snow White film. Grumpy, Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Happy, Doc and
  Sneezy.

+ [p. 23] "'I want someone who can look at the ashtray and tell me what
  kind of cigars I smoke.'"

  One of the first things Sherlock Holmes tells Watson, when they first
  meet, is that he has written a treatise on this subject. This contrasts
  oddly with Vimes' distrust of 'clues' in general (see the annotation for
  p. 142).

+ [p. 24] "'Where the sun doesn't shine'"

  A running gag from "`Lords and Ladies`_": the place where the sun does not
  shine, on the Discworld, is a valley in Slice, near Lancre.

+ [p. 25] "Clinkerbell"

  Tinkerbell via 'clinker', which is one type of mining by-product.

+ [p. 26] "Slab: Jus' say 'AarrghaarrghpleeassennononoUGH"

  Echoes the anti-drugs campaign slogan 'Just say no', championed most
  famously by Nancy Reagan in America.

+ [p. 26] "T'Bread Wi' T'Edge"

  A long-running series of British commercials for a certain brand of bread
  emphasised the Yorkshire origins of the manufacturer. This slogan is in a
  parody of a Yorkshire accent, presumably for similar reasons.

+ [p. 30] The shield design described is the Ankh-Morpork coat of arms, not
  shown in the front of the book (but on the cover of "`The Streets of
  Ankh-Morpork`_").

+ [p. 27] "'[...] he's got a loaded wolf.'"

  Possibly a reference to the Australian story of **The Loaded Dog**.

+ [p. 29] 'Daphne's ancestors came all the way from some islands on the
  other side of the Hub.'

  See the annotation for p. 9/9 of "`The Colour Of Magic`_", but specifically
  referring to the brown owls of New Zealand, which, to a British
  viewpoint, are 'some islands on the other side of the world'. Thus the
  morpork could be compared to the New Zealand brown owl.

+ [p. 30] "'Croissant Rouge Pursuivant'"

  The names of the heralds are adapted from terms used in English heraldry.
  'Pursuivant' is simply the title for an assistant herald. English
  pursuivants include the Rouge Croix (cf. Terry's Croissant Rouge) and
  Bluemantle (Terry gives us the 'Pardessus Chatain' or 'Brown Overcoat').

  Senior to the pursuivants are the kings of arms, although none really
  corresponds to 'Dragon'. This has been linked with 'Dracula' – the most
  famous vampire of all – which is itself a title meaning 'little dragon'.
  It also harks back to "`Guards! Guards!`_", in which a dragon actually
  *became* king of Ankh-Morpork, albeit briefly.

+ [p. 35] "'There are plenty of kosher butchers down in Long Hogmeat.'"

  Kosher butchering involves a special method of bleeding the animal, which
  would ensure that there was plenty of spare blood around. The name 'Long
  Hogmeat', however, is a bit more disturbing: apart from the question of
  how 'hogmeat' could be kosher, it also sounds suspiciously like 'long
  pig', which is pidgin for 'human flesh'. (See also the annotation for p.
  239/180 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 36] "Commander of the City Watch in 1688"

  1688 AD in England was the date of the 'Glorious [bloodless] Revolution'
  when the Catholic James II was deposed in favour of the Protestant Willem
  van Oranje, Stadholder of the Netherlands. He married Mary Stuart and
  became William III. "Old Stoneface", on the other hand, is clearly
  modelled on Oliver Cromwell, who ruled the Commonwealth (Republic) of
  England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland from 1652 to 1658, at one point
  refusing Parliament's offer of the crown. Among his many reforms, he
  championed religious freedom and tolerance, extending even to Jews, who
  were welcome in England for the first time since 1290.

+ [p. 36] More Latatian.

  "Excretus Est Ex Altitudine" – Shat On From a Great Height; "Depositatum
  De Latrina" – Chucked Down The Toilet.

+ [p. 38] "'The butcher, the baker and the candlestick-maker.'"

  From an old nursery rhyme:

    |   Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub
    |   And who do you think they were?
    |   The butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker...

+ [p. 41] "Commander Vimes, on the other hand, was all for giving criminals
  a short, sharp shock."

  "Short sharp shock" was coined in Gilbert & Sullivan's **The Mikado** as a
  euphemism for 'execution'. In 1980s Britain, Tory home secretaries used
  the phrase to refer to the brief-but-harsh imprisonment of young
  offenders.

+ [p. 44] "'Delphine Angua von Uberwald,' read the Dragon aloud."

  Uberwald (on "`The Discworld Mapp`_" spelled with an umlaut over the U) is
  'Over/beyond the forest' in German. In Latin, that's "Transylvania" – a
  part of Romania traditionally associated with the undead (most
  prominently, Count Dracula).

+ [p. 45] "Men said things like 'peace in our time' or 'an empire that
  will last a thousand years,' [...]"

  "peace in our time" – Neville Chamberlain, British Prime Minister, in
  1938.

  "an empire that will last a thousand years" – Adolf Hitler, on the Third
  Reich.

+ [p. 46] "Constable Visit was an Omnian, [...]"

  Read "`Small Gods`_" for much more information about Omnia. Brutha seems to
  have taken a religion devoted to violent conquest and turned it into
  something closely akin to modern evangelical Christianity.

+ [p. 54] "'Oh, well, if you prefer, I can recognize handwriting,' said
  the imp proudly."

  The original Apple Newton was the first PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)
  capable of doing this, and was even supposed to improve its recognition
  of the individual owner's writing with practice. In practice, it didn't
  work too well. Hence the joke:

      Q. How many Newton users does it take to change a lightbulb?
      A. Foux! There to eat lemons, axe gravy soup.

+ [p. 55] "Lord Vetinari had always said that punctuality was the
  politeness of princes."

  In our world, the **Oxford Dictionary of Quotations** attributes this
  saying to Louis XVIII.

+ [p. 55] "It is a pervasive and beguiling myth that the people who design
  instruments of death end up being killed by them."

  This myth may have been started by William Makepeace Thackery, who asked
  in his novel **The Adventures of Philip on His Way Through the World**:
  "Was not good Dr Guillotin executed by his own neat invention?". As Terry
  notes, he was not.

+ [p. 56] "'Can you paint a picture of his eye, Sydney?' [...] 'As big
  as you can.'"

  This idea has been used in many detective stories, but most famously in
  **Blade Runner**, where the main character is able to blow up a reflection
  in a photograph far beyond plausible limits.

+ [p. 63] "[...], or dribble some in their ear while they slept."

  A curious method of administering poison, most famously mentioned in
  **Hamlet**.

+ [p. 64] "'Crushed diamonds used to be in vogue for hundreds of years,
  despite the fact that they never worked.'"

  Crushed glass would theoretically work as a means of killing someone,
  because it forms jagged edges, but in practice the pieces are always
  either too big to go unnoticed or too small to have any effect. Aqua
  fortis is nitric acid, a *very* fast-acting poison if ingested...
  Cantharides is Spanish Fly, better known as an aphrodisiac, but quite
  poisonous in large doses.

+ [p. 65] "And that seemed about it, short of stripping the wallpaper off
  the wall."

  The most obvious red herring. One of the most popular theories regarding
  Napoleon Bonaparte's death is that he suffered arsenic poisoning from the
  green colouration in the wallpaper of the bedroom of the place in which
  he was being held. It has been suggested that microbes, present in the
  humid conditions of St Helena, could absorb the poison from the
  wallpaper, then be inhaled by the prisoner, giving him a small dose every
  day. The wallpaper is green, and the pigment involved is copper arsenite,
  known in Napoleon's day as "Paris Green".

+ [p. 68] "'But... you know I'm in the Peeled Nuts, sir...'"

  The equivalent in England today is called the Sealed Knot.

+ [p. 70] "Vimes's Ironheads *won*."

  A conflation of "Roundheads" and "Ironsides", two names for the
  Parliamentarian soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, clearly the model for
  Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes.

+ [p. 71] "**Twurp's Peerage**"

  See the annotation for p. 191/138 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 72] "But kill one wretched king and everyone calls you a regicide."

  There's an old joke about Abdul, who builds roads, raises cities,
  conquers nations, but is forever remembered as Abdul the Goat Fucker as a
  result of a youthful indiscretion.

+ [p. 73] "Vimes put the disorganized organizer back in his pocket."

  Posts made to USENET have a header field labelled 'Organization:'. Terry
  Pratchett's own posts give this as 'Disorganized'.

+ [p. 75] "... when I took you to see the Boomerang Biscuit exhibition."

  Curiously, Carrot seems to have taken Vimes to the Dwarf Bread museum
  before treating Angua to it.

+ [p. 77] "'Ah, h'druk g'har dWatch, Sh'rt'azs!' said Carrot."

  Littlebottom, in dwarfish, is "Sh'rt'azs". In British slang, 'shortarse'
  is a vaguely affectionate term for the vertically challenged.

+ [p. 81] "Igneous the troll backed away until he was up against his
  potter's wheel."

  Igneous' shop has several parallels with a shop in the Sherlock Holmes
  story of **The Six Napoleons**.

  Holmes encounters a pottery/stonework shop staffed mainly by Italians,
  who were also hiding out from the law and various other enemies, and is
  eventually asked to leave by the back door to avoid bothering the staff,
  which is locked with a large padlock. The figurines were also being used
  to conceal contraband.

  Terry comments: "My flabber is ghasted. I really did think I made that
  one up. I mean... I had the pottery already in existence from previous
  books, and I knew I'd want to bring it in later so I needed a pottery
  scene now to introduce it, and Igneous already had a rep as an 'ask no
  questions' type of merchant, and I needed somewhere clay could be stolen
  and the golems would have had to break in, the padlock replacing the lock
  they'd busted. And I knew that I'd need a way for the Watch to put
  pressure on Igneous; 'hollow items' for drugs and other contraband is a
  cliche, which ought to mean that his staff are somewhat outside the law.
  In other words the scene is quite a complex little jigsaw piece which
  slots into this plot and the ongoing DW saga in various places. I'll just
  have to pretend I knew what I was doing..."

+ [p. 84] "'It hasn't really got a name', said Angua, 'but sometimes we
  call it Biers.'"

  The perfect name for an undead bar. Puns on "beer", which you would
  normally associate with a tavern, and on "bier", which you would normally
  associate with being dead. Also puns on **Cheers**, the fictional Boston
  tavern in the long-running US TV comedy of the same name.

+ [p. 85] "'But sometimes it's good to go where everybody knows your
  shape.'"

  The theme song of **Cheers** contains the line "sometimes you want to go
  where everybody knows your name". See the annotation for p. 84, and the
  annotation for p. 298/225 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 86] "'That's Old Man Trouble,' said Angua. 'If you know what's good
  for you, you *don't* mind him.'"

  From the Gershwin song 'I Got Rhythm': "Old Man Trouble, I don't mind
  him".

+ [p. 89] "'[...] sunglasses tester for Argus Opticians... [...]'"

  A very appropriate name. Argus "the all-seeing" was the name of the
  many-eyed watchman from Greek mythology, who was tasked by Hera to
  keep an eye (so to speak) on Io, a human priestess who, after her
  seduction by Zeus, had been transformed into a cow in an attempt to
  keep Hera from getting suspicious. No such luck.

+ [p. 90] "'*These* words are from the Cenotine **Book of Truth**, [...]'"

  There have been a number of suggestions for the derivation of this name.
  The root "ken" in Hebrew means "honest, truthful, correct". "Cenogenesis"
  is a biological term meaning the development of an individual that is
  notably different from its group (such as happens to Dorfl in the book).
  Alternatively, for the atheists, there's the "ceno" in "cenotaph", from
  the Greek "kenos", meaning "empty".

+ [p. 91] Magazine titles.

  **Unadorned Facts** and **Battle Call** are plays on **The Plain Truth**,
  published by the Worldwide Church of God, and **War Cry**, published by the
  Salvation Army.

+ [p. 92] "'[...] Mr Dorfl.'"

  All he golems' names are Yiddish, and Dorfl is no exception, although I'm
  not too sure what his means. It could be a pun on "Stedtl", which means
  "ghetto" – Stadt is German for "town", Dorf for "village". In Austria,
  'Dorfl' is indeed a word used to denote a small village.

+ [p. 93] "'Feeding the yudasgoat?'"

  Or in English, 'Judas goat', named after the disciple who betrayed Jesus.

  Judas goats are used by slaughterhouses to lead sheep to the killing
  floor. The sheep cannot easily be driven, but the herding instinct will
  make them follow the goat.

+ [p. 94] "'I'm going to read your chem, Dorfl.'"

  "Chem", pronounced "shem", is Hebrew for "name".

  One common euphemism used by Orthodox Jews for "God" is "Ha-Shem",
  literally: "The Name", which ties in to that part of the Golem legend
  which involves writing the name of God on the Golem's forehead (the other
  variant has the vivifying word being "Emet" (Truth)).

+ [p. 95] "NOW THREE HUNDRED DAYS ALREADY. [...] WHAT WOULD I DO WITH TIME
  OFF?"

  Ending sentences with "already" is a common mannerism among
  Yiddish-speaking Jews in Anglophone countries. Rhetorical questions
  are another mainstay of Yiddish conversational style.

+ [p. 99] "HOLY DAY STARTS AT SUNSET."

  Jewish holy days do, indeed, run from sunset to sunset. Cf. Genesis 1:5:
  "The evening and the morning were the first day."

+ [p. 109] "*The Rites of Man*"

  Thomas Paine wrote a justification of the French Revolution entitled **The
  Rights of Man**

+ [p. 110] "[...], licking his fingers delicately to turn the thin pages."

  Another red herring. Putting poison on the pages of a book, so that it is
  self-administered to the reader in this way, is an idea famously used in
  Umberto Eco's medieval mystery **The Name of the Rose**.

+ [p. 115] "You came with me when they had that course at the YMPA.'"

  See the annotation for p. 88/88 of "`The Light Fantastic`_". The YMCA runs
  summer courses for children, and presumably for adults as well.

+ [p. 120] "'*Nobblyesse obligay*,' [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 235/206 of "`Reaper Man`_".

+ [p. 123] "'It's "a mess of pottage", [...]'"

  Another Old Testament reference.

  Esau sold his status as Abraham's firstborn son to his brother Jacob
  (Genesis 25:29-34) for a bowl of stew (pottage). Hence, a mess of
  pottage is the proverbial price of a birthright. This phrase was
  parodied by CS Lewis, who accused H. G. Wells of selling his
  birthright for "a pot of message" (that is, abandoning the purely
  imaginative books he did so well to push his political ideas).

+ [p. 123]  "'Who streals my prurse streals trasph, right?'"

  Iago would rather be robbed than slandered in **Othello**, act 3, scene 3:

    |   Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
    |   'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
    |   But he that filches from me my good name
    |   Robs me of that which not enriches him
    |   And makes me poor indeed.

+ [p. 124] "[...] he had got only six weeks to retirement [...]"

  The copper within days or hours of retirement has become a police movie
  cliche; traditionally, anyone who starts talking like this is likely to
  die within the short time left. Two examples occur in the films **Lethal
  Weapon 2** and **Falling Down**.

+ [p. 129] "'[...] ole Zhlob just used to plod along, [...]'"

  Another golem name: "Zhlob" is Yiddish for "boorish glutton" (or
  gluttonous boor). Probably Slavic in origin.

+ [p. 130] "As her tutors had said, there were two signs of a good
  alchemist: the Athletic and the Intellectual."

  Terry used this joke in a talk at the Australian National University in
  Canberra in 1994, but he was talking about a shift charge engineer in a
  nuclear power plant...

  The standard analytical technique to prove arsenic in chemical mixtures
  involves mixing the sample with zinc and adding sulphuric acid. If
  arsenic is present, this produces arsenic hydride as a gas; burning the
  gas, and holding the flame against a cool porcelain surface, leaves a
  black precipitation of metallic arsenic.

+ [p. 132] "'It's nine of the clock,' said the organizer, poking its
  head out of Vimes's pocket. '"I was unhappy because I had no shoes until
  I met a man with no feet."'"

  Refers to the regrettable trend among software producers to inflict a
  happy Thought For The Day on their users each time they open the
  software.

+ [p. 135] "One had a duck on his head, [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 272/204 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 136] "'Buggrit, millennium hand and shrimp!'"

  See the annotation for p. 324/233 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 138] "'Dibbuk? Where the hell are you?'"

  A dybbuk, in Jewish mythology, is a demonic spirit that possess the body
  of someone living.

+ [p. 140] "'We're all lyin' in the gutter, Fred. But some of us're lookin'
  at the stars...'"

  From Oscar Wilde, **Lady Windermere's Fan**, Act 3. Although it can't be
  easy to see the stars through all that fog.

+ [p. 142] "He distrusted the kind of person who'd take one look at
  another man and say in a lordly voice to his companion..."

  Terry is challenging the Sherlock Holmes school of detection as being "an
  insult to the glorious variety of human life." P G Wodehouse does the
  same in one of his PSmith stories, in which Psmith observes the local
  plumber sitting in his garden, dressed well because it's Sunday and
  reading Shakespeare because he likes it, while Psmith is studying the
  "How To Detect" booklet that says a plumber is unlikely to dress
  well/read Shakespeare.

+ [p. 143] "It wasn't by eliminating the impossible that you got at the
  truth, however improbable..."

  Another dig at Holmes, who said precisely this.

+ [p. 145] The description of Vetinari's drawing matches the cover of the
  original publication of Thomas Hobbes' **Leviathan**, possibly *the* most
  influential work of mainstream political theory.

  The book argues that for people to come together in a society, they
  cannot help but create a structure larger than themselves, which must
  have a controlling intelligence of its own, i.e. some sort of governing
  body. Hence, although political power derives from the common people, it
  must be superior to them.

+ [p. 147] "[...] you might as well accuse the wallpaper of driving him
  mad. Mind you, that horrible green colour would drive anyone insane..."

  See the annotation for p. 65.

  A number of people also wrote to say that they were reminded of Charlotte
  Perkins Gilman's story **The Yellow Wallpaper** (1892), about a woman who
  is indeed driven mad by wallpaper.

+ [p. 148] "'We're known for rings, sir.'"

  Alberich the dwarf forges the Ring that is the centrepiece of Wagner's
  interminable Ring Cycle, based on Norse legend. Tolkien uses the same
  source, and his One Ring is not unlike Alberich's.

+ [p. 150] "Drumknott delicately licked his finger and turned a page."

  See the note for p. 110.

+ [p. 153] "It was called the Rats Chamber."

  This is another multidirectional pun. First, in German, the word for
  'council chamber' is Ratskammer. Second, it's an anagram of Star Chamber,
  a special civil and criminal court in England. Created by Henry VII in
  1487, abolished by the Long Parliament in 1641 following abuses under
  James I and Charles I. The court took its name from a star-shaped
  decoration in the ceiling.

  The decoration in the ceiling of the Rats Chamber – a group of rats with
  their tails tied together – is called a rat king. According to Maarten
  't Hart, in **Rats** (translated from the Dutch), some 57 rat kings have
  been found since the 17th century, although several are of dubious
  authenticity. They are often found alive, and can contain as few as three
  or as many as 32 members, although seven is the commonest number. Members
  are of both sexes, and almost always of the same age group, which may be
  young or adult. Rat kings are generally formed of black rats (Rattus
  rattus), although there is one occurrence of field rats (found in Java)
  and several of squirrels. No-one knows quite why they form, although one
  theory is that black rats (which have longer and more pliable tails than
  other breeds) get something sticky on their tails, and get tangled up
  when they groom each other, or while playing or fighting.

  Apparently, a modern artist decided to make a work of art depicting a
  rat-king, and even put it on the internet. See Katharina Fritsch:
  Rat-King (Rattenkoenig), 1993
  <http://www.diacenter.org/exhibs/fritsch/ratking/> (which also has an
  essay on the rat king through history).

+ [p. ???] "[...] Mrs Rosemary Palm, head of the Guild of Seamstresses
  [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 121/119 of "`Equal Rites`_".

+ [p. 155] "'Remember when he made his horse a city councillor?'"

  Caligula, Emperor of Rome from 37 to 41 AD, famously appointed his horse
  Incitatus as Consul to show his contempt for the Senate.

+ [p. 158] "'Genua wrote to Ankh-Morpork and asked to be sent one of our
  generals to be their king [...] The history books say that we sent our
  loyal General Tacticus, whose first act after obtaining the crown was to
  declare war on Ankh-Morpork.'"

  Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, 1763-1844, was a French general who
  became King Karl XIV John of Sweden and Norway. The youngest son of a
  French lawyer, Bernadotte joined the French army in 1780, becoming an
  officer in 1792, during the French Revolution. Recognising his brilliance
  in the field, the Emperor Napoleon eventually elevated him to the rank of
  prince. In Sweden, where Gustav IV had abdicated (1809) and been
  succeeded by the childless Karl XIII, Napoleon supported Bernadotte as
  heir to the throne. In August 1810, he was elected crown prince as Karl
  John. In 1813 he joined the allies against Napoleon.

+ [p. 162] "Constable Visit had told him the meek would inherit [the
  world], [...]"

  Another parallel between Omnianism and Christianity. See Matthew 5:5.

+ [p. 165] "'you've got to have the noses poking through the pastry...'"

  Similar to Stargazy pie, a Cornish dish that has fish heads poking
  through the pastry all around the edge of the dish.

+ [p. 177] "'... push off back to the Yard, job done and dusted.'"

  This phrase relates to the act of distempering a wall – another oblique
  hint at the wallpaper theory.

+ [p. 181] "'*Now* we're cooking with charcoal!'"

  The expression "cooking with gas" dates back to an advertising campaign
  designed to persuade people of the advantages of gas over electricity.

+ [p. 189] "*'She feels the need,' [...] 'Yeah, the need to feed.'*"

  In the movie **Top Gun**, the pilots boast that they 'feel the need; the
  need for speed.'

+ [p. 190] "That horrible green wallpaper."

  By the time Vimes has this idea (see the annotation for p. 65), he
  already knows enough to dismiss it in fairly short order.

+ [p. 195] "'Then there's this one about the Klatchian who walks into a
  pub with a tiny piano – '"

  The joke as adapted by thee goode folkes of alt.fan.pratchett goes like
  this:

  This Klatchian walked into a pub carrying a small piano. He puts in on
  the bar and has a few drinks. When it comes time to pay up he says to
  the publican, "I bet you double or nothing I can show you the most
  amazing thing you ever saw."

  "Okay, but I warn you, I've seen some weird stuff."

  The Klatchian takes out a tiny stool, which he sits in front of the
  piano. He then reaches into his robes and pulls out a box, about a
  foot long, with tiny air-holes in it. He takes off the lid and inside
  is a tiny man, fast asleep. As the lid opens he wakes up. Instantly he
  jumps to the piano and plays a perfect rendition of 'The Shades of
  Ankh-Morpork'! Then, as everyone in the bar is clapping, he jumps back
  into the box and closes the lid.

  "Wow!" The publican says, and wipes the slate clean. "If I give you
  another drink, could you do it again?" The Klatchian agrees. This time
  the little man plays the Hedgehog song, to thunderous applause.

  "I gotta ask, where did you get that?"

  "Well, a few months ago I was travelling across the deserts of Klatch,
  when I suddenly came across a glass bottle. I picked it up and rubbed
  it and lo and behold, out popped a Genie. For some reason it was
  holding a curved bone to his ear and talking to it."

  "'Genie,' I said to him, 'I have freed you, and in return I ask only
  three wishes.'"

  "'Huh?' The genie said, looking at me for the first time. 'Oh, OK, three,
  whatever.' He then started talking to the bone again."

  "'Genie, I would like a million bucks!' I said to him."

  "Did you get it?"

  "Not exactly. The genie kept talking to the bone and he waved one of his
  hands. Instantly, I was surrounded by a million ducks. Then they flew
  away."

  "What was your second wish?"

  "I said to him: 'I want to be the ruler the world!' the Genie was still
  talking to his bone, but he waved his free hand and a piece of wood
  appeared, with inches marked on it."

  "Oh, a ruler. It sounds like the genie wasn't paying much attention. Did
  you get your third wish?"

  "Let me put it like this: do you really think I asked for a twelve-inch
  pianist?"

  Most correspondent feel that the "extreme cases" are exactly the kind

  encountered on an almost weekly basis.

  The monster breaking into pieces and then reassembling itself is probably

  "`Soul Music`_"), but there are earlier references. In **The Iron Man** by Ted
  Hughes (1968) the iron man/robot falls over the edge of a cliff and
  breaks into many pieces. The fingers put the hands together then they
  pick up an eye and start putting the rest of the body together.

  Although there are a few fictional uses of this method of poisoning,
  Terry himself explains that his source was an "attempt on the life of

  alchemist Francesco Borri checked up on the candles. He found the candles
  in the bedchamber were heavier than similar candles elsewhere and found
  that two and a half pounds of arsenic has been added to the batch."

+ [p. 258] "He landed on the king's back, flung one arm around its neck,
  and began to pound on its head with the hilt of his sword. It staggered
  and tried to reach up to pull him off."

  In **Robocop 2**, our hero (Robo) jumped on the back of the 'Robocop 2' and
  tried to open its head.

+ [p. 260] "'They gave their own golem too many, I can see that."

  The way the king golem is driven mad by the number of rules in its head
  reminded many people of a scene in **Robocop 2**, where Robocop is rendered
  useless by programming with several, partly conflicting rules. This
  slightly tenuous connection is reinforced by several further similarities
  between Dorfl and Robocop.

  Never mind Robocop, however: one correspondent has posited that the
  entire candle factory sequence is a clever amalgam of the endings to
  *both* **Terminator** movies. I will let him explain this to you in his
  own words – I couldn't bring myself to paraphrase or edit it down:

  "The candle factory itself, with all the candle production lines is
  reminiscent of the robotics in the automated factory that Reese
  activates to confuse the Terminator. Throughout the candle factory
  scene, Carrot is Reese, Angua is Sarah Connor, the king switches
  between the original T-800 when fighting Carrot and the T-1000 from T2
  when fighting Dorfl, who is the 'good' Terminator from T2.

  Carrot is shot early on and has to be dragged around initially by
  Angua, much like the injured Reese has to be supported by Sarah. The
  following fight between Dorfl and the king is similar to the big T2
  confrontation between the two Terminators, in which one of the
  combatants is able to 'repair' himself and thus has an advantage. When
  Dorfl is 'killed', his red eyes fade out just like a T-800s, but he is
  later able to come back to life. The T-800 achieves this by rerouting
  power through undamaged circuitry; Dorfl does it by getting the words
  from elsewhere (heart as opposed to head).

  In T1, Reese finds a metal bar and tries to fight an opponent he can't
  possibly beat – exactly as Carrot does. When Angua finds herself
  facing the injured king, it is similar to the scene in T1 after
  Reese's death, when the torso of the Terminator pulls itself along
  after the injured Sarah, grabbing at her legs (which the king also
  does to Angua). Then, Detritus' shot at the king, which has no effect,
  is like Sarah's last stand against the T-1000, when she runs out of
  ammo just at the crucial point. When it appears that the seemingly
  invincible king has survived everything and is about to finish the job
  and kill Carrot, the thought-to-be-dead Dorfl makes a last-gasp
  interjection which finally kills the king – much like the resurrected
  Arnie appears just in time to kill the T-1000 in T2. Oh, and finally,
  the molten tallow that Cheery almost falls into is, of course, the
  molten metal at the end of T2."

+ [p. 260] "'We can rebuild him,' said Carrot hoarsely. 'We have the
  pottery.'"

  From the 70s TV series **The Six Million Dollar Man**": "We can rebuild him.
  We have the technology."

+ [p. 272] "'Undead Or Alive, You Are Coming With Me!'"

  Another echo of Robocop.

+ [p. 278] "'He's just made of clay, Vimes.' 'Aren't we all, sir?
  According to them pamphlets Constable Visit keeps handing out.'"

  Another parallel between Omnianism and Christianity. See Genesis 2:7. (In
  fact, the idea of God as a potter and humans as clay is a recurring
  metaphor in the Bible. See, e.g., Job 33:6, Isaiah 64:8, Jeremiah 18:6.)

+ [p. 279] "'The thought occurs, sir, that if Commander Vimes did not
  exist you would have had to invent him.'"

  Parallels a famous saying of Voltaire (1694-1778): "If God did not exist,
  it would be necessary to invent him."

+ [p. 280] "'To Serve The Public Trust, Protect The Innocent, And
  Seriously Prod Buttock.'"

  The first two of these were also the first two of Robocop's prime
  directives.

+ [p. 283] Dorfl's plan to liberate his fellow golems seems to take a lot
  for granted (e.g. that they will all decide, once free, to join him).

  Terry himself describes what he envisages happening next:

  "While I wasn't planning to feature this in another book, I suspect the
  sequence of events, given Dorfl's character, would run like this:

      1. Dorfl saves up to buy the next golem
      2. Golems suddenly become very pricey
      3. Dorfl does extra shifts and go on saving
      4. Price of golems goes up
      5. Several merchants recieved a friendly visit from the Commander of
         the Watch to discuss matters of common interest
      6. Golems available to Dorfl at very reasonable prices.

  I want more golems on the city payroll. How else can they resurrect the
  fire service?"

  The names of the golems, again, are Yiddish. "Klutz" – a clumsy clod or
  bungler (from German); "Bobkes" – beans, but only metaphorically;
  something worthless or nonsensical (from Russian); "Shmata" – a rag, or
  piece of cloth; used both literally and to describe a person of weak
  character (from Polish).

+ [p. 285] "'*Not* a problem, me old china,' he said."

  Rhyming slang: china plate – mate, friend.

+ [p. 285] "'Somewhere, A Crime Is Happening,' said Dorfl."

  Another Robocop line.

+ [p. 285] "'But When I Am Off Duty I Will Gladly Dispute With The Priest
  Of The Most Worthy God.'"

  However, Dorfl has just told Vimes that he will never *be* off duty...
