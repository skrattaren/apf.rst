+ [p. 6] "'Nac mac Feegle!'"

  The Feegles speak a version of Scots. In theory this is closely related
  to English, and an English speaker can usually understand Scots with a
  bit of effort, but this very thick dialect is largely incomprehensible to
  most English speakers. Terry himself warns against trying to decode all
  of their sayings – the important thing is the impression you get, not
  the exact words – but some of them are straightforward enough.

  Of the 'battle cries', 'Bigjobs!' is the catchphrase of Mek-Quake, one of
  the 'ABC Warriors' in the cult comic **2000 AD**; 'Dere c'n onlie be whin
  t'ousand!' seems to be based on the tagline of the film **Highlander**:
  'There can be only one!'; and 'Nac mac Feegle wha hae!' echoes Robert
  Burns's 'Scots wha hae' – although this makes little sense on its own...

+ [p. 8] "Do they *really* think that spelling their name backwards fools
  anyone?"

  There are many vampire movies in which this trick works remarkably well:
  in **Son of Dracula** (1943), Count 'Alucard' travels to the southern USA
  to marry a disturbed woman who wants to be immortal; in **Dracula's Last
  Rites** (1979), vampire Dr A. Lucard runs a mortuary, which keeps him
  well-stocked with fresh bodies. The same trick occurs in **Dracula: the
  Series** (1990), and the films **Dr Terror's Galaxy of Horrors** (1966) and
  **Dracula: the Dirty Old Man** (1969).

+ [p. 11] "Not, of course, with her reflection in the glass, because *that*
  kind of heroine will sooner or later end up singing a duet with Mr Blue
  Bird and other forest creatures [...]"

  Various Disney heroines have done this: Snow White was the first, but
  Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty perpetrated similar offences. In the film
  **Mary Poppins**, Julie Andrews sings in harmony with her own reflection
  ('A Spoonful of Sugar') and does indeed go on to sing with other
  creatures. 'Mr Blue Bird' comes into the song 'Zippedy Doo-Dah', from the
  Disney film **Song of the South**, although there may be some older
  reference.

+ [p. 13] "If you needed to boil an egg, you sang fifteen verses of 'Where
  Has All The Custard Gone?' under your breath."

  Possibly the Lancrastrian version of 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone?',
  which can also be used for egg-timing purposes.

+ [p. 14] "'You got to come to Mrs Ivy and her baby missus!'"

  Ivy is an evergreen plant that continues growing even on dead trees;
  hence it is sometimes a symbol of immortality, persistence of life.

+ [p. 15] "'I thought old Mrs Patternoster was seeing to her.'"

  Paternoster (Latin for 'Our Father') generally refers to the Lord's
  Prayer in Latin, as said by Roman Catholics until the 1960s.

+ [p. 18] "WELL, I HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. A couple of coins landed
  on the frosty road."

  See the annotation for p. 30/25 of "Mort_".

+ [p. 19] "Later on, there'd be a command performance by that man who put
  weasels down his trousers,"

  A traditional stunt act in Yorkshire, only with ferrets rather than
  weasels.

+ [p. 21] "Now the Quite Reverend Oats looked at himself in the mirror."

  In the Anglican church, a priest is known as 'Reverend', a dean is 'Very
  Reverend', a bishop is 'Right Reverend', an archbishop 'Most Reverend'.

  Oats's name may be a reference to Titus Oates, a 17th-century English
  clergyman who in 1678 alleged that Jesuits were planning to assassinate
  Charles II and place his Roman Catholic brother James, Duke of York
  (later James II), on the throne. In the subsequent wave of anti-Catholic
  hysteria, Oates was gratefully rewarded, and about 35 innocent people
  were executed. In 1685, after James acceded to the throne, Oates was
  convicted of perjury, flogged, and imprisoned. He was released and given
  a pension after James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

+ [p. 27] "Lancre people didn't bother much with letterboxes."

  All the same, it seems that arrangements have moved on since "`Lords and
  Ladies`_", in which the mail was left hanging in a sack in the town for
  people to collect in their own time.

+ [p. 30] "'[...] an' it's bein' used up on der Copperhead road tonight.'"

  The name is Terry's tribute to Steve Earle, a large, 'new country' singer
  who recorded a song called 'Copperhead Road'. A copperhead is a poisonous
  snake native to parts of the eastern and southern USA.

+ [p. 32] "'It is as well to remember that your ancestors [...] firmly
  believed that they couldn't cross a stream.'"

  Some vampire stories include a prohibition against crossing running
  water. Although it's worth mentioning that this only ever prevented them
  from crossing streams under their own propulsion – they could still be
  *carried* across it, e.g. in a coach.

+ [p. 38] "'the worst she can put her hand up to at her age is a few grubby
  nappies and keepin' you awake at night. That's hardly *sinful*, to my
  mind.'"

  St Augustine, in his **Confessions**, pointed to the attention-seeking
  behaviour of babies as evidence that even the most innocent are selfish,
  because of original sin.

+ [p. 39] "'If Klatch sneezes, Ankh-Morpork catches a cold.'"

  'If "foo" sneezes, "bar" catches a cold' has become a cliche in
  economics. "foo" and "bar" may be pretty much any combination of America,
  Japan, Europe and Asia.

+ [p. 39] "'The "werewolf economies", as the Patrician in Ankh-Morpork
  calls them.'"

  The East Asian economies of South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand
  and others that grew outstandingly fast throughout the 1980s and 90s are
  sometimes collectively called the 'Tiger Economies'.

+ [p. 41] "'"shave and a haircut, no legs"'"

  The usual tune is 'Shave and a haircut, two pence'. See also the
  annotation for p. 47/36 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 51] "'We eat only fish this month. [...] Because the prophet Brutha
  eschewed meat, um, while he was wandering in the desert, see.'"

  The Christian fast of Lent, originally a period of abstaining from all
  'rich food', commemorates Christ's time spent fasting in the wilderness,
  during which Satan tempted him with bread. See Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke
  4:1-14. For the full story of Brutha, read "`Small Gods`_".

+ [p. 52] "'Wstfgl?' said Agnes."

  The earliest occurrence of this non-word that anyone has yet reported is
  in **Asterix the Legionary**, when Obelix catches sight of the beautiful
  Fabella. Terry says: "You've got me there... I thought I'd just strung
  together some letters!"

  But there's something about this set of letters, because Ptraci says the
  same thing in "Pyramids_", and in "`Feet of Clay`_", in her sleep, Sybil says
  'wsfgl'. There's also Astfgl, the 'villain' of "Eric_". More
  significantly, if you search for "wstfgl" on the Web, you'll find it
  cropping up in all sorts of apparently unrelated stories in a similar
  context – the noise people make when they're either asleep or lost for
  words.

  We may be witnessing the birth of a new word.

+ [p. 54] "'I do not drink... wine,' said Igor haughtily."

  This line, with the dramatic pause before the word 'wine', appears in
  many different movie versions of **Dracula**, starting with Bela Lugosi's
  1931 classic version, down to the Francis Ford Coppola 1992 remake **Bram
  Stoker's Dracula**.

  The line itself does not occur in the book, but originated in the
  Hamilton Deane stage-play **Dracula**, which was hugely successful in New
  York in the 1920s.

+ [p. 55] "'There wath none of thith fumble-finger thtuff and then pinching
  a brain out of the "Really Inthane" jar and hopin' no one'd notithe.'"

  At least one of the early Frankenstein films (which are clearly the main
  inspiration for Igor) involves the servant being sent to steal the brain
  of a famous scientist from a medical lab, but he drops that one and
  substitutes one labelled 'Abnormal', which is then transplanted into the
  monster.

+ [p. 59] "'Vlad de Magpyr,' said Vlad, bowing."

  Bram Stoker borrowed the name 'Dracula' from Vlad Dracula, 'the Impaler',
  1431-1476, prince of Wallachia. This Vlad was as brutal and psychopathic
  a ruler as you could ever hope to avoid, but there is no historical
  evidence that he either drank blood or dabbled in sorcery.

  The name 'Magpyr' puns both on magpie and Magyar, an equestrian tribe who
  settled in what is now Hungary and parts of Romania during the 9th
  century. Dracula would have been a Magyar. Nowadays, the word is more or
  less synonymous with 'Hungarian'.

+ [p. 59] "'Or, we prefer, vampyres. With a "y". It's more modern.'"

  This spelling has a very old pedigree, but has become a hallmark of
  certain modern-day vampire fans who, like the Count, want to distance
  themselves from traditional beliefs about vampires. I blame Anne Rice.

+ [p. 60] "'And this is my daughter, Lacrimosa.'"

  'Lacrimosa' is Latin for 'tearful one', which seems appropriate to
  Lacci's whiney personality. It's also the first word of the traditional
  Latin requiem mass:

    |   Lacrymosa dies illa
    |   quae resurget ex favilla
    |   judicandus homo reus.

    |   Huic ergo parce, Deus,
    |   pie Jesu, Jesu Domine,
    |   dona eis requiem.

  Which translates approximately to:

    |   O tearful the day
    |   when from the ashes rises
    |   the guilty to be judged.

    |   Therefore spare him, God,
    |   Good Jesus, Jesus Lord,
    |   give them rest.

+ [p. 62] "'The Queen makes up some sort of headache pills out of willow
  bark."

  As previously noted (see the annotation for p. 119 of "Hogfather_"),
  willow bark contains aspirin.

+ [p. 63] "Agnes's left arm twitched [...] as if guided by a mind of its
  own."

  The hero of the cult horror parody **Evil Dead II** has a similar problem,
  which he eventually resolves by cutting off his own hand; this scene
  could well be partly inspired by the film.

+ [p. 72] "national anthems [...] all have the same second verse, which
  goes 'nur... hnur... mur... nur nur, hnur... nur... nur, hnur' at some
  length, until everyone remembers the last line of the first verse and
  sings it as loudly as they can."

  Not long after the publication of "`Carpe Jugulum`_", Terry wrote the
  Ankh-Morpork national anthem along these lines, set to original music by
  Carl Davis.

+ [p. 75] "'The trolls are stupid, the dwarfs are devious, the pixies are
  evil and the gnomes stick in your teeth.'"

  Later in the book, it appears that gnomes and pixies are the same thing,
  but Vlad seems to think differently.

+ [p. 82] "'Good morning, Mister Magpie,' said Agnes automatically."

  As Agnes and Nanny go on to discuss, there are many different counting
  rhymes for magpies, but they generally agree that a single magpie is
  unlucky. Some people believe that one can avert the bad luck by being
  polite, or even downright flattering, to the magpie in this manner.

  The rhyme Agnes repeats over the next few pages is similar to the one
  Mike learned as a child:

    |   One for sorrow, two for joy,
    |   Three for a girl, four for a boy,
    |   Five for silver, six for gold,
    |   Seven for a secret never to be told.

  Nanny's version seems closer to the Scots version given in **Brewer's
  Dictionary of Phrase & Fable**:

    |   One's sorrow, two's mirth,
    |   Three's a wedding, four's a birth,
    |   Five's a christening, six a dearth,
    |   Seven's heaven, eight is hell,
    |   And nine's the devil his ane sel'.

  – although Nanny's also varies noticeably from this, which just goes to
  prove what she says about there being lots of different rhymes.

+ [p. 90] "'Lady Strigoiul said her daughter has taken to calling herself
  Wendy,' [...] 'Maladora Krvoijac does,' said Vlad."

  In Romanian, 'strigoi' or 'strigoiaca' is the modern form of the ancient
  Roman 'stryx', a type of shape-changing, bloodsucking witch. 'Krvopijac'
  is either Bulgarian or Croatian for 'blood-drinker'.

+ [p. 91] "'*Le sang nouveau est arrive*,' said Vlad."

  Every year, towards the end of October, the first press of the year's
  Beaujolais wine is marketed as 'Beaujolais nouveau', announced with the
  slogan 'Le Beaujolais nouveau est arrive.' The wine is generally quite
  strong, both in alcohol content and flavour, and not highly regarded by
  connoisseurs. After a few months it becomes undrinkable, owing to the
  accelerated fermentation process.

+ [p. 91] "'That is the double snake symbol of the Djelibeybian water
  cult,' he said calmly."

  In "Pyramids_", the Djelibeybian high priest Dios had a staff with two
  serpents entwined around it – possibly the same symbol. There are at
  least three distinct theories about why holy symbols repel vampires. The
  Catholic theory is that the repelling force is the faith of the holder,
  and the symbol merely focuses that faith – so a symbol on its own, or in
  the hands of a non-believer, is useless. (This has produced some
  interesting interpretations of what a 'holy symbol' could be – one film
  shows a yuppie repelling a vampire with his wallet.) The Orthodox theory
  is that faith is irrelevant – it's God who is performing the miracle,
  not the wielder. The psychological theory, which Terry seems to be
  subscribing to here, is that the effect is entirely in the mind of the
  vampire.

+ [p. 98] "'Although having studied the passage in question in the original
  Second Omnian IV text, I have advanced the rather daring theory that the
  word in question translates more accurately as
  "cockroaches".'"

  Exodus 22:18: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." It is often
  suggested that the Hebrew word used here should be translated 'poisoner',
  but the case for this is unconvincing and based mainly on the flawed
  Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint. Modern
  translations of the Bible still say 'witch'.

+ [p. 99-100] "'Look, there was this donkey, and it stopped in the middle
  of the river, and it wouldn't go backwards or forwards, [...] Bad Ass.
  See?'"

  This is slightly reminiscent of the Biblical story of Balaam's ass
  (Numbers 22:1-41).

+ [p. 100] "Agnes had seen pictures of an ostrich. So... start with one of
  them, but make the head and neck in violent yellow, and give the head a
  huge ruff of red and purple feathers and two big round eyes, the pupils
  of which jiggled drunkenly as the head moved back and forth..."

  The description may be modelled on 'Emu', property of Rod Hull; their
  double act was very popular on UK TV in the 1970s.

+ [p. 100] "'Take that thing out of your mouth,' said Agnes. 'You sound
  like Mr Punch.'"

  Mr Punch is the lead character in a Punch-and-Judy show, a traditional
  British children's entertainment featuring theft, extreme violence,
  wife-beating and multiple murders, using glove puppets. The performer
  would use a special throat-whistle, called a swozzle, to produce the
  character's squeaky voice. See also the Discworld short story **Theatre of
  Cruelty**.

+ [p. 103] "A huge gilded china beer stein that played 'Ich Bin Ein
  Rattarsedschwein' from **The Student Horse** [...]"

  'Ich Bin Ein Rattarsedschwein' means 'I am a Drunken Pig', rat-arsed
  being British slang for very drunk. **The Student Horse** refers to **The
  Student Prince**, an operetta by Romberg about a prince who studies at
  Heidelberg and falls for a barmaid. In the film, allegedly, Mario Lanza
  was supposed to play the part of the prince, but got too fat, so his
  voice is just dubbed over the lead actor's when singing. Songs include
  the 'Drinking Song' and the unfortunately titled 'Come Boys, Let's All Be
  Gay Boys'.

+ [p. 104] "'Why did you bring Soapy Sam back with you?'"

  The original 'Soapy Sam' was Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford from
  1845 to 1869, best remembered today for his diehard opposition to the
  theory of evolution. The name is occasionally applied today as a generic
  insult to any churchman who holds an opinion contrary to one's own.

+ [p. 106] "'I believe that in Glitz you have to fill their mouth with
  salt, hammer a carrot into both ears, and then cut off their head.' 'I
  can see it must've been fun finding that out.'"

  Terry is here parodying, but not even slightly exaggerating, the
  bewildering variety of ways of dealing with vampires in earth mythology.
  To give a taste of how abstruse these beliefs could become, here is a
  quotation from the alt.vampyres FAQ (held on
  <http://www.altvampyres.net/>:

  "Some Gypsies in Kosova once believed that a brother and sister born
  together as twins on a Saturday could see a vampiric mulo if they wore
  their underwear and shirts inside out. The mulo would flee as soon as it
  was seen by the twins."

+ [p. 120] "'You were so successful in Escrow, I know.'"

  Escrow is a legal term for a formal contract or agreement to do
  something, where the document is held by a trusted third party until its
  conditions are satisfied.

+ [p. 121] "'Every day, in every way, we get better and better,'"

  One of the very first positive-thinking mantras, coined by Emile Coue
  (1857-1926), French psychotherapist and pharmacist. Coue's study of
  hypnotism convinced him that auto-suggestion could cure anything.

+ [p. 123] "They stared into the abyss, which didn't stare back."

  A famous quotation from Nietzsche: "If you gaze for long into an abyss,
  the abyss gazes also into you." (From **Beyond Good and Evil**.)

+ [p. 126] "She pushed gently until her toes were pointed at the sky and
  she was doing a handstand on the edge."

  Agnes is imitating Lara Croft, hero of the hugely successful **Tomb
  Raider** series of video games. Terry admits to being a Lara fan.

+ [p. 128] "'Oh, that's the witch,' said Nanny. 'She's not a problem.'"

  There's a cave in Somerset, near where Terry lives, with a similar
  feature outside it.

+ [p. 138] "'Like the hero in Tsort or wherever it was, who was completely
  invincible except for his heel [...]'"

  See the annotation for p. 274/241 of "`Witches Abroad`_".

+ [p. 139] "The man lowered the thimble. 'Pictsies!'"

  Puns on 'pixie' and 'Picts' (inhabitants of Scotland in Iron Age times).

+ [p. 141] "Hundreds of pixies had simply appeared among the ornaments.
  Most of them wore pointed hats that curved so that the point was
  practically pointing down."

  Combined with the blue skin, this suggests a decidedly Smurf-like quality
  to the Feegles. Terry says:

  "1 I wanted some background to Wee Mad Arthur, of "`Feet of Clay`_" and so
  they'd be small. 2 I'd been listening to Laureena McKennitt singing 'The
  Stolen Child'. 3 Since (see 1) the tribe would be cod-Scottish, then
  **Braveheart** and **Rob Roy** ("let's bash the English" movies made by
  people sitting on the biggest piece of land ever stolen from its owners
  by trickery, genocide and war) were natural targets... which meant that
  the NmF would be blue..."

+ [p. 143] "'Yez lukin' at a faceful o'heid!_'"

  Typical Glaswegian greeting. See also p. 169 "'What ya' lookin a', chymie
  (Jimmy)?'"

+ [p. 148] "'You mean vampirism is like... pyramid selling?'"

  Pyramid selling is when each of your customers goes out and sells to a
  number of other customers, and you get a share of the profits from them;
  then each of those other customers goes out and tries the same trick, and
  so on until everyone in the world is a customer. Of course, if you're one
  of the last generation to be recruited, you're stuffed. Most
  pyramid-selling schemes are illegal in most countries. The scam is a
  common nuisance phenomenon on the Internet.

+ [p. 150] "'Ah... Aunt Carmilla...'"

  **Carmilla**, by J. Sheridan LeFanu, was one of the earliest literary
  vampire stories, published in 1872, a good quarter of a century before
  **Dracula**. The story about bathing in the blood of virgins is told of
  Erzsebet Bathory (1560-1614), a Hungarian princess who believed that it
  would keep her young; her name is often associated with vampire stories.

  The beaked, hunched figure that Vlad calls 'a distant ancestor' is a
  reference to the stryx, a creature from Roman mythology that stabbed and
  drank blood through its beak.

  Terry explains: "What Agnes is shown is the 'evolution' of vampires –
  harpy, hairy monster, Lugosi/Lee and Byronic bastard. And what better way
  to demonstrate this that a succession of family portraits?"

  "As an aside, very little vampiric legend and folklore in CJ is made up
  – even the vampire tools and watermelons are real world beliefs."

+ [p. 154] "'... *The blood is the life [...] porphyria, lack of?*'"

  Oats has crammed an impressive collection of vampire stories into one
  page of notes. "The blood is the life" is a catchphrase from **Dracula**;
  it is closely associated with the Christian view of the vampire – just
  as the Christian gains eternal life through the sacrament of Christ's
  blood, so the vampire earns a perverted version of the same.

  Porphyria is a very rare, genetic blood disorder, one form of which
  includes the symptoms of severe light sensitivity, reddish-brown urine
  and teeth, deformation of the nose, ears, eyelids, and fingers, an excess
  of body hair, and anaemia. It has been suggested that it explains some
  aspects of both vampire and werewolf legends.

+ [p. 155] "On one shelf alone he found forty-three remarkably similar
  accounts of a great flood, [...]"

  The Biblical version is the story of Noah (Genesis 6-8). Many myth cycles
  have a similar story of how humanity was *almost* wiped out by a flood,
  but saved by one good person building a boat.

+ [p. 159] "'This is from Ossory's **Malleus Maleficarum**,'"

  The **Malleus Maleficarum** (usually translated **Hammer of Witches**) was
  written by two Dominican monks in the 15th century as a manual for
  dealing with witches and possessing spirits. Many of the popular myths
  about medieval treatment of witches, including many of the various tests
  by ordeal, first appeared in this book. See also the annotation for p.
  375/262 of "`Good Omens`_".

+ [p. 168] "'yin, tan, TETRA!'"

  This is an old northern English (*not* Scots) dialect, used for counting
  sheep in Yorkshire and Cumbria. 'Yan, tan, tethera, methera, pip,
  sethera, lethera, hovera, dovera, dick.'

  According to one correspondent, the folklorist A. L. Lloyd traced the
  words to a group of Romanian shepherds brought to England early in the
  19th century to teach the locals something about increase in flocks. The
  words were thought very Occult and Mysterious, until it was explained
  that they were just counting.

+ [p. 169] "'Well done,' Verence murmured. 'How long have you been a
  hallucination? *Jolly* good.'"

  Verence's side of the dialogue seems to be modelled on the sorts of
  things the British royal family, most particularly Prince Charles, say
  when they are meeting The People. Verence's general earnest and well
  meaning – but unappreciated – interest in the welfare of his subjects
  is strongly reminiscent of Charles.

+ [p. 180] "Up the airy mountain and down the rushy glen ran the Nac mac
  Feegle,"

  From **The Fairies**, by William Allingham:

    |   Up the airy mountain
    |   Down the rushy glen,
    |   We daren't go a-hunting,
    |   For fear of little men;

  See also the annotation for p.287/207 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 180] "'Hakkis lugs awa'!'"

  'Hack his lugs away' – cut his ears off.

+ [p. 180] "'An' b'side, she'll gi'us uskabarch muckell.'"

  Just to make their dialect even more confusing, the Feegles throw in
  words of Gaelic. 'Uskabarch' is 'uisge beatha', 'water of life' –
  whisky.

+ [p. 193] "'Will ye no' have a huge dram and a burned bannock while yer
  waiting?'"

  The usual offering is a 'wee dram', but to the Feegles it would, of
  course, appear huge. A bannock is a well known Scottish bread
  product. The fact that it's burned could be a reference to the Battle of
  Bannockburn, a famous Scots victory.

+ [p. 195] "'I've read about the phoenix. It's a mythical creature, a
  symbol, a –'"

  The phoenix as described by the Greek historian Herodotus was an
  eagle-like bird, with red and gold plumage, that was sacred to the
  sun-god in ancient Egypt. The bird lived for 500 years, at the end of
  which it built its own funeral pyre and was consumed to ashes, from which
  another phoenix would then rise. Allegedly symbolic of the rising and
  setting of the sun, it was adopted by medieval Christianity as a symbol
  of death and resurrection.

+ [p. 199] "'Oh, yes, sir, 'cos of when the other side are yelling "We're
  gonna cut yer tonk– yer *tongue* off,"'"

  In "`Interesting Times`_" we learned that, on the Disc, 'psychological
  warfare' is defined as drumming on your shield and shouting "We're gonna
  cut yer *tonkers* off."

+ [p. 205] "'Aye, mucken! Born sicky, imhoe!'"

  A common abbreviation used on parts of the Internet is IMHO, meaning 'in
  my humble opinion'. Terry seems to have a particular dislike for this
  phrase, which in practice often translates to "and anyone who disagrees
  with me is patently a moron".

+ [p. 205] "'Ach, I wouldna' gi'ye skeppens for him –'"

  This is very similar to a recurrent line "I wadna gie a button for her",
  in Robert Burns's poem **Sic a Wife as Willie's Wife**. The poem describes
  the vile, vile looking wife of a wee 'greasy weaver' (no Adonis himself),
  and when performed usually has the audience in stitches when the
  descriptions of the wife are mimed. It is a good party piece for a Burns
  Supper on 25 January.

+ [p. 206] "'So she's made up some brose for ye...'"

  Brose is a famous Scottish pick-me-up, made with oats, whisky, cream
  and... herbs.

+ [p. 206] "'I thought you turned into bats!' she shouted to Vlad."

  Discworld vampires used to do this (in "`Reaper Man`_" and "`Witches Abroad`_",
  for instance), but more recently they have taken to flying without
  changing form. Presumably it's another aspect of being a Modern vampire.

+ [p. 209] "'It's called "Om Is In His Holy Temple".'"

  'God is in His Holy Temple' was a popular Victorian hymn.

+ [p. 213] "'... *and Brutha said to Simony, "Where there is darkness we
  will make a great light*..."'"

  Isaiah 9:2: "The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
  they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the
  light shined."

+ [p. 223] "It read: 'HLISTEN TO ZEE CHILDREN OFF DER NIGHT... VOT
  VONDERFUL MHUSICK DEY MAKE. Mnftrd. by Bergholt Stuttley Johnson,
  Ankh-Morpork.' 'It's a Johnson,' she breathed. 'I haven't got my hands on
  a Johnson for ages...'"

  Combined with Igor's previous comment that 'the Century of the Fruitbat
  has its compensations', this suggests that B. S. Johnson was active
  within the past hundred years – the first solid clue we've had about his
  lifetime. The 'children of the night' quote is one of the most famous
  lines from the original 1931 **Dracula** movie.

  'Johnson' is American slang for a penis, so this single entendre is quite
  an admission from Nanny.

+ [p. 223] "'"Thunderclap 14"? "Wolf Howl 5"?'"

  Organ registers are named after the sound they make, and the height of
  tone they produce. Owing to the nature of sound, however, 14 is very
  rarely found in real life; it would be 1. out of tune; most registers are
  powers of two, or three times powers of two for quints; and 2. pretty
  low.

+ [p. 242] "No, thought Agnes. It'll take the nightmares away."

  There is a quotation, attributed to G. K. Chesterton: "Fairy tales do not
  tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons
  exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed." This seems
  to chime remarkably well with Terry's own attitude to children's stories.

+ [p. 247] "'Do you remember Mr and Mrs Harker?'"

  Jonathan and Mina Harker are two of the leading characters in **Dracula**.

+ [p. 247] "'Do onions hurt us? Are we frightened of shallots? No.'"

  The hero of the classic 1954 novel **I am Legend**, the last living human
  on an earth where everyone else has become a vampire, actually
  experiments with this possibility.

+ [p. 248] "Greebo sheathed his claws and went back to sleep."

  This is the second time Greebo has taken out a vampire – he ate a bat in
  "`Witches Abroad`_" – which suggests that there *are* other ways of killing
  them than those sophisticated methods prescribed by folklore.

+ [p. 249] "'– burn, with a clear bright light –'"

  A very tame, sweet, modern children's hymn (see the annotation for p.
  279):

    |   Jesus bids us shine with a pure clear light
    |   Like a little candle, burning in the night.
    |   In this world of darkness so we must shine,
    |   You in your small corner and I in mine.

+ [p. 255] "'Remember – that which does not kill us can only make us
  stronger."

  "That which does not kill me, makes me stronger" – popular saying,
  attributed to Nietzsche, whose morality would certainly have appealed to
  the Count.

+ [p. 256] "'Lines and crosses and circles... oh, my...'"

  Echoes 'Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!' from **The Wizard of Oz**.

+ [p. 257] "'And I'd watch that bloke with the stake. He's altogether too
  keen on it. I reckon there's some psychology there –'"

  It's become a commonplace observation, about **Dracula**, that a man
  driving a stake into a female vampire is about as strong a sexual image
  as it was possible to publish in Victorian times...

+ [p. 261] "'They've killed Thcrapth! The bathtardth!'"

  A running joke in the adult cartoon **South Park** is how the character
  Kenny is killed, in some deeply implausible way, in every episode,
  whereupon Kyle and Stan exchange the comments "Oh my god! They've killed
  Kenny!" "You bastards!"

+ [p. 266] "'Griminir the Impaler, she was.'"

  Grimnir the Impaler (1514-1553, 1553-1557, 1557-1562, 1562-1567 and
  1568-1573) is mentioned in "`Wyrd Sisters`_". The difference in spelling is
  presumably a typo.

+ [p. 268] "'Old Red Eyeth ith back!'"

  One of Frank Sinatra's later albums bore the title 'Old Blue Eyes is
  Back'. 'Old Red Eyes is Back' is also the title of a song by Beautiful
  South.

+ [p. 275] "Oats's gaze went out across the haze, and the forest, and the
  purple mountains."

  For some reason, mountains often seem to be described as 'purple' in the
  context of noble or uplifting thoughts. Compare the song 'America the
  Beautiful', by Katharine Lee Bates:

    |   O beautiful for spacious skies,
    |   For amber waves of grain,
    |   For purple mountain majesties
    |   Above the fruited plain!

+ [p. 279] "The singing wasn't very enthusiastic, though, until Oats tossed
  aside the noisome songbook and taught them some of the songs he
  remembered from his grandmother, full of fire and thunder and death and
  justice and tunes you could actually whistle, with titles like 'Om Shall
  Trample The Ungodly' and 'Lift Me To The Skies' and 'Light The Good
  Light'."

  Many modern churches have sanitised their official hymnbooks, leaving
  many of their worshippers complaining vigorously about the insipidness of
  the new hymns. 'Light The Good Light' is presumably the Omnian version of
  'Fight the Good Fight'; 'Om Shall Trample The Ungodly' is less clear, but
  it could scan to the tune of 'The Battle-Hymn of the Republic.'
