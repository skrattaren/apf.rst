The Fifth Elephant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ [p. 20] "'The crowning of the Low King,' said Carrot."

  Resonates with the semi-mythical High Kings of Ireland and Britain in our
  world's history, who ruled over autonomous lesser kingdoms. As Dwarf
  kingdoms are underground, with the most important bits being deepest, it
  makes sense for their king of kings to be set *under* his subjects,
  rather than above.

+ [p. 21] "'[...] Uberwald remains a mystery inside a riddle wrapped in an
  enigma.'"

  A slight paraphrase of what Churchill originally said about Russia. See
  also the annotation for p. 176/133 of "`Men At Arms`_".

+ [p. 28] "'The Scone of Stone. A replica, of course.'"

  The Stone of Scone, aka The Stone of Destiny, aka Jacob's Pillow or
  Pillar, is the coronation stone that Scottish kings were crowned on. The
  stone was moved to England by Edward I after he defeated the Scots in
  1296, and has since then been part of the English monarchy's coronation
  chair (except for the 4 months after Christmas Day 1950, when the Stone
  was stolen by Scots Nationalists before being recovered at Arbroath Abbey
  on April 11, 1951).

  Currently, the Stone (although rumours of it being a fake one abound) is
  "on loan" to Scotland, and can be seen in Edinburgh Castle.

+ [p. 29] "'[...] all the Low Kings have done that ever since B'hrian
  Bloodaxe, fifteen hundred years ago.'"

  Brian Boru (c.940-1014) was the most famous of the Irish High Kings.

  Brian Bloodaxe, on the other hand, was the name of a platforms 'n ladders
  style computer game for the Sinclair Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC,
  etc. in the mid-1980s.

+ [p. 39] "[...] Ping said, 'It's a dialect word meaning "watermeadow",
  sir.'"

  According to Terry, 'ping' *is* in fact a Cornish dialect word meaning
  'watermeadow'.

+ [p. 42] "'They act as if B'hrian Bloodaxe was still alive. That's why we
  call them *drudak'ak*.'"

  Echoes of Chassidic Jews, the Amish, or basically any traditional,
  ultra-orthodox movement in Roundworld religions.

+ [p. 49] "'Inigo Skimmer, sir. Mhm-mhm.'"

  People tried to read a reference to **The Princess Bride**'s Inigo Montoya
  character in the name, but Terry said:

  "Inigo is just a name. So is Skimmer. It's not an intentional reference
  to anything. [...] if you are a certain age, were brought up in the UK
  and were taught history in a certain way, you recalled Inigo Jones as a
  famous 17th Century architect – mostly remembered because he had a
  memorable name."

+ [p. 56] "'Very *fast* coffee. I rather think you will like it.'"

  Espresso. Duh.

+ [p. 60] "The first page showed the crest of the Unholy Empire [...]"

  Shades of both Holy Russia and the Holy Roman Empire.

  Tsar Ivan "the Terrible" nailed some visiting Turkish ambassadors'
  turbans to their heads when he felt they did not show him the proper
  respect.

  (But the same story is also told of Vlad 'Dracula': supposedly, the
  Venetian ambassadors failed to take their skullcaps off before him,
  explaining that they had special dispensation saying that they were
  allowed to keep their heads covered even in the presence of the Pope,
  whereupon Uncle Vlad had the caps nailed to their heads.)

+ [p. 60] "The crest was altogether too florid for Vimes's taste, and was
  dominated by a double-headed bat."

  The coat of arms of the Russian royal family, the Romanovs, sported the
  black double-headed eagle, which also crops up in different colours in
  other Eastern European heraldry, such as the Austria-Hungary coat of
  arms. It also crops up (very batlike – black on red) in the Albanian
  flag.

  Apparently the double-headed eagle specifically came to symbolise
  Imperial power in heraldry, as opposed to the single-headed eagles, which
  were more generally used for conventional royalty and kingdoms in that
  area of the world.

  Going back further in time, the Holy Roman Empire (see the previous
  annotation) also used a double-headed eagle in the 15th century.

+ [p. 61] "'Silver has not been mined in Uberwald since the Diet of Bugs in
  AM 1880 [...]'"

  The Diet of Worms (or **Reichstag zu Worms** as the Germans refer to it)
  was a political council (influenced by the Roman Catholic church) that
  took place in the town of Worms in 1521. It was during this session that
  Martin Luther was called upon to defend his Reformist teachings against
  Pope Leo X's threat of excommunication. When he refused to recant, he was
  ordered to leave and declared to be an outlaw as per the Edict of Worms.

+ [p. 65] "[...] a production of **Chicken Lake**."

  Chicken Lake -> Swan Lake.

+ [p. 66] "'And you shall have some corn, provided locally by Josiah
  Frument and Sons [...]'"

  'Frument' means grain (from the Latin 'frumentum'). Frumenty (porridge
  made from wheat) was an important medieval and Renaissance peasant
  staple.

+ [p. 86] "[...] he was making headway with the religious instruction of
  the pigeons."

  Overtones of St. Francis of Assisi, who famously preached to the birds.
  See also the annotation for p. 68/40 of "`Good Omens`_".

+ [p. 174] "'Sybil wants to go to take the waters at Bad Heisses Bad---"

  "Heisses Bad" is German for Hot Bath.

+ [p. 226] "'How beautiful the snow is, sisters...'"

  This whole section is a riff on Chekhov's 1901 play **Three Sisters**,
  complete with Chekhovian misunderstandings and pauses.

+ [p. 227] "'If we moved to Bonk [...]'"

  The three provincial sisters in the Chekhov play are always remembering
  their past in Moscow, but only the younger sister is the one with the
  idea and desire to get out.

+ [p. 228] "'We have the gloomy and purposeless trousers of Uncle Vanya,'
  said one, doubtfully."

  **Uncle Vanya** is the other great Chekhov play. "Gloomy and purposeless"
  sums up much Chekhovian drama quite accurately. The Russian word is
  "toska" – a sort of weary, faded ennui.

  Uncle Vanya's trousers, interestingly enough, are not actually featured
  in either of Chekhov's plays. As Terry pointed out on afp: "Well, yes.
  Vimes got them."

+ [p. 253] "She'd called them 'sub-human'"

  A literal translation of the Nazi term 'Untermensch', used to describe
  all non-Aryan people.

+ [p. 255] "Blow the bloody doors off!"

  Intentional or not, this piece has resonances with the UK classic cult
  movie **The Italian Job**. One character is instructed by another to open a
  safe and ends up blowing up the entire van, thus leading to the famous
  line "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!". Detritus
  exhibits a similar amount of overkill here.

+ [p. 278] "'Ah, yes... "joy through strength".'"

  Slogans like these resonate strongly with the slogans used by Nazi
  Germany, such as "Arbeit Macht Frei" ("Work Brings Freedom"), infamously
  used above the entrances of various Nazi concentration camps.

  "Strength through Joy" ("Kraft durch Freude") was the name of a large
  German National Socialist labour organisation, which provided affordable
  leisure activities for its members such as concerts and cruises. Early
  prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were in fact known as **KdF-Wagen**.

+ [p. 310] "'Is that why he's got human ears all over his back?' 'Early
  experiment, thur.'"

  There was a famous tissue engineering experiment done at the University
  of Massachusetts (MIT), in which a biodegradable, ear-shaped scaffold was
  impregnated with human cartilage cells, and then successfully grafted
  onto the back of a mouse.

  The resulting picture of the living mouse with the ear-like structure on
  his back became very well known, although the story is often misconstrued
  as involving genetic engineering or the transplantation of an actual
  human ear, neither of which was the case.
