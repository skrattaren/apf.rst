I Shall Wear Midnight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ This book is in the planning stages only. No scheduled release date is
  known.

+ Terry mentioned this novel at the Discworld Convention 2004. It will be
  the fourth Tiffany Aching novel, and "depending on what happens in [it]",
  there may be a fifth one. But either fourth or fifth book will be the
  last one.

+ For an explanation of the title, see the annotation for p. 333 of **A Hat
  Full Of Sky**
