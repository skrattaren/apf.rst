Lords And Ladies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 5/5] "[...] young Magrat, she of the [...] tendency to be soppy about
  raindrops and roses and whiskers on kittens."

  One of the best songs from **The Sound of Music** is called 'My Favourite
  Things' (it's the song Maria sings for the Von Trapp children when they
  are all frightened of the thunderstorm). The opening verse goes:

    |   Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
    |   Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
    |   Brown paper packages, tied up with strings,
    |   These are a few of my favourite things.

  The Von Trapp children would probably have murdered Magrat if she had
  been their governess.

- [p. 13/11] "But that was a long time ago, in the past [footnote: Which is
  another country]"

  This might refer to **Hamlet**, where the future is described as "The
  undiscover'd country from whose bourn / No traveller returns", or perhaps
  Terry has read **The Go-between**, a 1950 book by L. P. Hartley, which
  opens with the words: "The past is a foreign country; they do things
  differently there", which has become a familiar quotation in England.

- [p. 13/11] "And besides, the bitch is... ...older."

  This is another Christopher Marlowe quote, from **The Jew of Malta** (act
  IV, scene i):

      Barnadine:
        "Thou hast committed –"

      Barabas:
        "Fornication? But that was in another country; and besides, the wench
        is dead."

- [p. 20/16] "This was the octarine grass country."

  A reference to (Kentucky) bluegrass country.

- [p. 20/16] "Then, [...] the young corn lay down. In a circle."

  An explanation of the Crop Circle phenomenon might be in order here.

  Crop Circles are circular patches of flattened crops which have appeared
  in fields of cereals in the South and West of England over the last few
  years. There is no firm evidence pointing to their cause: this has been
  taken by certain parties as a prima facie proof that they are of course
  caused by either alien spacecraft or by some supernatural intelligence,
  possibly in an attempt to communicate.

  In recent years, circle systems have become increasingly elaborate, most
  notably in the case of a circle in the shape of the Mandelbrot Set, and
  another system which is shown on the cover of the recent Led Zeppelin
  compilation album, which seems to indicate that whoever's up there they
  probably have long hair and say **Wow!** and **Yeah!** a lot. A number of
  staged circle-forging challenges in the summer of '92 have demonstrated
  both how easy it is to produce an impressive circle by mundane, not to
  say frivolous methods, and also the surprisingly poor ability of
  'cereologists' to distinguish what they describe as a "genuine" circle
  from one "merely made by hoaxers".

  Anyone with a burning desire to believe in paranormal explanations is
  invited to post to the newsgroup sci.skeptic an article asserting
  essentially "I believe that crop circles are produced by UFO's/Sun
  Spots/The Conservative Government/The Easter Bunny" and see how far they
  get....

- [p. 24/19] "Nanny Ogg never did any housework herself, but she was the
  cause of housework in other people."

  Over on alt.fan.pratchett it was postulated that this sounded a bit too
  much like a quote not to be a quote (annotation-hunters can get downright
  paranoid at times), but it took us a while to figure out where it
  originated, although in retrospect we could have used Occam's razor and
  looked it up in Shakespeare immediately. In **King Henry IV, part 2**, act
  1, scene 2, Falstaff says: "I am not only witty in myself, but the cause
  that wit is in other men."

- [p. 27/21] "Some people are born to kingship. Some achieve kingship, or
  at least Arch-Generalissimo-Father-of-His-Countryship. But Verence had
  kingship thrust upon him."

  The original quote is (as usual) by William Shakespeare, from **Twelfth
  Night** (act 2, scene 5), where Malvolio reads in a letter (which he
  thinks was written to him by his mistress):

      "In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
      are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness
      thrust upon 'em."

  The dictator most associated with the phrase
  'Arch-Generalissimo-Father-of-His-Countryship' is probably Franco.

- [p. 28/21] "Now he was inspecting a complicated piece of equipment. It
  had a pair of shafts for a horse, and the rest of it looked like a
  cartful of windmills. [...] 'It's a patent crop rotator,' said Verence."

  The patent crop rotator is an agricultural tool that might not figure
  very prominently in your day-to-day conversation (possibly since no such
  machine exists: crop rotation means growing different things in a field
  in successive years) but British comedy writers are apparently fascinated
  by it. Several people wrote to tell me that the cult TV comedy series
  **The Young Ones** also used the patent crop rotator in their episode
  **Bambi**.

  When Neil (the hippy) is testing Rick (the nerd) on medieval history, the
  following dialogue ensues (edited somewhat for clarity):

      Rick:
        'Crop rotation in the 14th century was considerably more widespread...
        after... God I know this... don't tell me...  after 1172?'

      Neil:
        'John.'

      Rick:
        'Crop rotation in the 14th century was considerably more widespread
        after John?'

      Neil:
        '...Lloyd invented the patent crop rotator.'

- [p. 29/22] "'I asked Boggi's in Ankh-Morpork to send up their best
  dress-maker [...]'"

  Boggi's = Gucci's.

- [p. 38/29] "[...] it was always cheaper to build a new 33-MegaLith circle
  than upgrade an old slow one [...]"

  Think CPU's and MHz.

- [p. 40/30] "I LIKE TO THINK I AM A PICKER-UP OF UNCONSIDERED TRIFLES.
  Death grinned hopefully."

  In Shakespeare's **The Winter's Tale** we find the character Autolycus ("a
  Rogue"), saying in act 4, scene 2:

      "My father named me Autolycus; who being, as I am, littered under
      Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles."

- [p. 42/31] "'My lord Lankin?'"

  Lord Lankin is a character in a traditional folk ballad:

    |   Then Lankin's tane a sharp knife
    |   that hung down by his gaire
    |   And he has gi'en the bonny nane
    |   A deep wound and a sair

- [p. 67/50] "One of them was known as Herne the Hunted. He was the god of
  the chase and the hunt. More or less."

  See the annotation for p. 145/144 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 78/57] The names of the would-be junior witches.

  Two of the names resonate with the names used in "`Good Omens`_": Agnes Nitt
  is similar to Agnes Nutter, and Amanita DeVice (Amanita is also the name
  of a gender of deadly poisonous mushrooms) is similar to Anathema Device.
  There's also a Perdita in Shakespeare's **The Winter's Tale**; the name
  means 'damned' or 'lost'.

  In fact, all these names are based on the names of the so-called
  Lancashire Witches. The deeds of this group on and around Pendle Hill
  were the subject of probably England's most famous 17th century witchhunt
  and trials. The story is described in some fictional detail in a
  little-known book called, surprise, **The Lancashire Witches**, written at
  the end of the nineteenth century in Manchester by William Harrison
  Ainsworth.

  Interestingly enough, Ainsworth also wrote a book called **Windsor Castle**
  in which Herne the Hunter appears as a major character (see previous
  annotation).

- [p. 85/62] The names of the "new directions".

  'East of the Sun, West of the Moon': a fairly well-known phrase used,
  amongst others, by Tolkien in a poem, by Theodore Roosevelt as the title
  for a book on hunting, and by pop-group A-ha as an album title. It
  originally is the title of an old Scandinavian fairy tale, which can be
  found in a book by Kay Nielsen, titled **East of the Sun and West of the
  Moon – Old Tales from the North**. Terry has confirmed that this book was
  his source for the phrase.

  'Behind the North Wind': from the title of a book by George McDonald: **At
  the Back of the North Wind**, the term itself being a translation of
  **Hyperborea**.

  'At the Back Of Beyond': an idiom, perhaps originating from Sir Walter
  Scott's **The Antiquary**: "Whirled them to the back o' beyont".

  'There and Back Again': The sub-title of Tolkien's **The Hobbit**.

  'Beyond the Fields We Know': from Lord Dunsany's novel **The King of
  Elfland's Daughter**, where "the fields we know" refers to our world, as
  opposed to Elfland, which lies 'beyond'. The phrase was also used as the
  title of a collection of Dunsany's stories.

- [p. 86/63] "'You know, ooh-jar boards and cards [...] and paddlin' with
  the occult.'"

  ooh-jar = Ouija. See the annotation for p. 154/136 of "`Reaper Man`_".

- [p. 90/66] "'... and to my freind Gytha Ogg I leave my bedde and the rag
  rugge the smith in Bad Ass made for me, [...]'"

  The origins of the 'rag rugge' are more fully explained in "`Equal Rites`_".

- [p. 103/76] "'Kings are a bit magical, mind. They can cure dandruff and
  that.'"

  Well, for one thing kings can cure dandruff by permanently removing
  people's heads from their shoulders, but I think that what Terry is
  probably referring to here is the folk-superstition that says that a
  King's touch can cure scrofula (also known as the King's Evil), which is
  a tubercular infection of the lymphatic glands.

  A similar type of legend occurs in Tolkien's **The Lord of the Rings**, but
  Shakespeare also has a lot to say on the subject in **Macbeth**, act 4,
  scene 3.

- [p. 105/76] "Within were the eight members of the Lancre Morris Men [...]
  getting to grips with a new art form."

  In fact, many real life Morris teams put on so-called 'Mummers Plays':
  traditional plays with a common theme of death and resurrection. These
  ritual plays are performed on certain key days of the year, such as
  Midwinter's Day (Magrat's wedding is on Midsummer's Eve!), Easter, or All
  Souls Day (Halloween), at which time the Soul Cake play is performed. I
  am also told that a Soul Cake, traditionally served at All Souls, is
  similar to a Madeira Sponge (or 'yellow cake' as the Americans call it).

- [p. 106/77] "'We could do the Stick and Bucket Dance,' volunteered Baker
  the weaver."

  There are Morris dances that use sticks, but according to my sources
  there aren't any that use buckets. Jason's reluctance to do this dance
  has its parallels in real world Morris dancing: at least in one area
  (upstate New York), a dance called the Webley Twizzle has a reputation
  for being hazardous to one's health, which is perhaps why it's hardly
  ever danced. It has even been claimed that someone broke his leg doing
  it, although no one seems to know any details. Of course, the reluctance
  of the Lancre Morris Men to perform the 'Stick and Bucket' may also have
  to do with the fact that the name of the dance very probably indicates
  another 'mettyfor' along the lines of maypoles and broomsticks.

  See the "`...and Dance`_" section in Chapter 5 for more information about
  Morris dancing.

+ [p. 106/77] "'I repaired a pump for one once. Artisan wells.'"

  Jason Ogg is thinking of Artesian Wells, a kind of well that gets its
  name from the French town of Artois, where they were first drilled in the
  12th century.

- [p. 106/77] "'And why's there got to be a lion in it?' said Baker the
  weaver."

  Because the play-within-a-play performed by the rude mechanicals in **A
  Midsummer Night's Dream** (act 1, scene 2) also features a lion in a
  starring role, of course.

  The Morris Men's discussions on plays and lions reminded one of my
  sources of the play written by Moominpapa in **Moominsummer Madness** by
  Tove Jansson. When asked about it, Terry said that although he has read
  the Moomin books, the lion dialogue is not connected with them.

- [p. 106/78] "'Hah, I can just see a real playsmith putting *donkeys* in a
  play!'"

  **A Midsummer Night's Dream**, by that mediocre hack-writer William S., is
  an example of a real play that *has* a donkey in it. Or to be absolutely
  precise, a character magically cursed with a donkey's head.

- [p. 109/79] "The Librarian looked out at the jolting scenery. He was
  sulking. This had a lot to do with the new bright collar around his neck
  with the word "PONGO" on it. Someone was going to suffer for this."

  The taxonomic name for orangutans is 'Pongo pygmaeus'. And of course
  Pongo is a popular dog name as well, doubling the insult.

- [p. 118/86] "[...] universes swoop and spiral around one another like
  [...] a squadron of Yossarians with middle-ear trouble."

  Terry writes: "Can it be that this is forgotten? Yossarian – the 'hero'
  of **Catch-22** – was the bomber pilot who flew to the target twisting and
  jinking in an effort to avoid the flak – as opposed to the Ivy League
  types who just flew nice and straight..."

  A minor correction: Yossarian was not the pilot, but rather the
  bombardier, who kept screaming instructions to the pilot over the
  intercom, to turn hard right, dive, etc.

- [p. 118/86] "The universe doesn't much care if you step on a butterfly.
  There are plenty more butterflies."

  This immediately recalls the famous science fiction short story **A Sound
  of Thunder**, by Ray Bradbury, which has as its basic premise that the
  universe cares very much indeed if someone steps on a butterfly.

- [p. 121/89] "'Good morning, Hodgesaargh,' she said."

  Hodgesaargh is based on Dave Hodges, a UK fan who runs a project called
  **The REAL Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy**. This is a computer database
  containing a couple of thousand entries (the project began in 1987) in
  the style of Douglas Adams's **Hitch Hiker's Guide**. Dave takes his Guide
  along with him to SF conventions and events, where he auctions off
  printed versions of the Guide in order to raise money for charity. This
  is why the Guide is not readily available, e.g. on the Internet.

  One of the entries in the Guide concerns a computer virus called "Terry",
  which, it says, "autographs all the files on the disk as well as any
  nearby manuals".

  In real life Dave Hodges works for a firm that keeps birds away from
  airports and other places. To this purpose he sometimes uses a falcon
  called, yes, Lady Jane, who bites all the time, which gave Terry the idea
  for the character Hodgesaargh.

  Note that there exist at least two other "let's write a Hitch Hikers
  Guide" projects on the Internet that I know of. One of these is the
  **Project Galactic Guide**, which can be reached on the Web through the
  URL: <http://www.galactic-guide.com/>

- [p. 123/89] "Verence, being king, was allowed a gyrfalcon [...]"

  The complex issues of class distinction in falconry apparently existed in
  medieval times just as Terry describes them here. In **The Once and Future
  King**, T. H. White quotes a paragraph by Abbess Juliana Berners: "An
  emperor was allowed an eagle, a king could have a jerfalcon, and after
  that there was the peregrine for an earl, the merlin for a lady, the
  goshawk for a yeoman, the sparrow hawk for a priest, and the musket for a
  holy-water clerk."

- [p. 133/97] "[...] five flavours, known as 'up', 'down', 'sideways', 'sex
  appeal', and 'peppermint'."

  The flavours of resons are a satire of the somewhat odd naming scheme
  modern physicists have chosen for the different known quarks, namely:
  'up', 'down', 'strange', 'charm', and 'beauty' (in order of discovery and
  increasing mass).

  Since theoretical physicists don't like odd numbers they have postulated
  the existence of a sixth quark – 'truth', which was only recently
  created at FermiLab in the USA.

  The beauty and truth quarks are often called 'bottom' and 'top'
  respectively. In earlier times (and sometimes even now), the strange
  quark was indeed called 'sideways'.

- [p. 133/97] "_resons`_" [footnote: Lit: 'Thing-ies']"

  In Latin 'res' does indeed mean 'thing'.

- [p. 141/103] "'You are in my kingdom, woman,' said the Queen. 'You do not
  come or go without the leave of me.'"

  This has echoes of another traditional ballad, this time 'Tam Lin':

    |   Why come you to Carterhaugh
    |   Without command of me?
    |   I'll come and go, young Janet said,
    |   And ask no leave of thee

  As with some of the other folk song extracts Terry is closer to the
  recorded (in this case Fairport Convention) version than to the very
  early text in (say) the **Oxford Book of Ballads**.

- [p. 144/104] "'Head for the gap between the Piper and the Drummer!'"

  There are several stone circles in England similar to the Dancers.
  Usually, legend has it that a group of dancers, revellers, ball players,
  etc. got turned to stone by the devil's trickery, for not keeping the
  Sabbath, or for having too much fun, or some other awful transgression.
  The Merry Maidens stone circle, with two nearby standing stones known as
  the Pipers, is one such site in Cornwall; the Stanton Drew stone circles
  near Bristol, the petrified remains of a wedding party that got out of
  control, also include a stone circle said to be dancers with a nearby set
  of stones representing the fiddlers.

- [p. 153/111] "Magrat had tried explaining things to Mrs Scorbic the cook,
  but the woman's three chins wobbled so menacingly at words like
  'vitamins' that she'd made an excuse to back out of the kitchen."

  The technical name for vitamin C is ascorbic acid.

- [p. 163/118] "'Like the horseshoe thing. [...] Nothing to do with its
  shape.'"

  Granny refers to the traditional explanation for hanging horseshoes over
  the door, which is that they bring luck, but only if placed with the open
  side up – otherwise the luck would just run out the bottom.

- [p. 172/125] "'Good morrow, brothers, and wherehap do we whist this merry
  day?' said Carter the baker."

  It is impossible to list all the ways in which the sections about the
  Lancre Morris Men and the play they are performing parodies the
  play-within-a-play that occurs in **A Midsummer Night's Dream**. The only
  way to get full enjoyment here is to just go out and read Shakespeare.
  While you're at it, pay particular attention to the names and occupations
  of both Terry's and William's 'Rude Mechanicals'.

- [p. 173/125] "'And we're Rude Mechanicals as well?' said Baker the
  weaver."

  Baker's next three lines are "Bum!", "Drawers!" and "Belly!". These come
  from a song by Flanders and Swann, which is called 'P**! P*! B****! B**!
  D******!'. The first verse goes:

    |   Ma's out, Pa's out, let's talk rude!
    |   Pee! Po! Belly! Bum! Drawers!
    |   Dance in the garden in the nude,
    |   Pee! Po! Belly! Bum! Drawers!
    |   Let's write rude words all down the street;
    |   Stick out our tongues at the people we meet;
    |   Let's have an intellectual treat!
    |   Pee! Po! Belly! Bum! Drawers!

- [p. 174/126] "'Yeah, everyone knows 'tis your delight on a shining
  night', said Thatcher the carter."

  It is relevant that Thatcher is making this remark to Carpenter the
  poacher, because it is a line from the chorus of an English folk song
  called 'The Lincolnshire Poacher':

    |   When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire
    |   Full well I served my master for more than seven year'
    |   'Til I took up to poaching, as you shall quickly hear

    |   Oh 'tis my delight on a shining night
    |   In the season of the year!

- [p. 174/126] The three paths leading from the cross-roads in the woods
  are variously described as being "all thorns and briars", "all winding",
  and the last (which the Lancre Morris Men decide to take) as "Ferns grew
  thickly alongside it".

  This echoes the poem and folk song 'Thomas the Rhymer', about a man who
  followes the Queen of Elves to Elfland:

    |   O see ye not yon narrow road,
    |   So thick beset wi' thorns and riers?
    |   That is the Path of Righteousness,
    |   Though after it but few enquires.

    |   And see ye not yon braid, braid road,
    |   That lies across the lily leven?
    |   That is the Path of Wickedness,
    |   Though some call it the Road to Heaven.

    |   And see ye not yon bonny road
    |   That winds about the fernie brae?
    |   That is the Road to fair Elfland,
    |   Where thou and I this night maun gae.

- [p. 177/128] "'But it ain't April!', neighbours told themselves [...]"

  Inconsistency time! On p. 154/135 of "`Witches Abroad`_", Granny responds to
  Nanny Ogg's intention of taking a bath with the words "My word, doesn't
  autumn roll around quickly".

  In subsequent discussions on the net it was postulated that Nanny's bath
  habits could well be explained by taking into account the fact that the
  Discworld has eight seasons (see first footnote in "`The Colour of Magic`_"
  on p. 11/11), which might result in e.g. two autumns a year. And of
  course, on our world April *is* indeed a month in Autumn – in the
  southern hemisphere (don't ask me if that also holds for a Discworld,
  though).

  Personally, I tend to agree with Terry, who has once said: "There are
  *no* inconsistencies in the Discworld books; occasionally, however, there
  are alternate pasts".

- [p. 191/138] "[...] fed up with books of etiquette and lineage and
  **Twurp's Peerage** [...]"

  **Burke's Peerage** is a book that lists the hereditary titled nobility of
  the British Realm (the Peers of the Realm, hence the title of the book).
  It contains biographical facts such as when they were born, what title(s)
  they hold, who they're married to, children, relationships to other
  peers, etc. For example, under 'Westminster, Duke of' it will give
  details of when the title was created, who has held it and who holds it
  now.

  Also, 'twerp' and 'berk' (also spelt as 'burk') are both terms of abuse,
  with 'twerp' being relatively innocent, but with 'berk' coming from the
  Cockney rhyming slang for 'Berkshire Hunt', meaning 'cunt'.

- [p. 191/138] "It probably looked beautiful on the Lady of Shallot, [...]"

  Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote a well-known poem called **The Lady of
  Shalott** (see also e.g. Agatha Christie's **The Mirror Crack'd**). A
  shallot (double l, single t), however, is a small greenish/purple
  (octarine?) onion.

+ [p. 193/139] "'I mean, we used to have a tradition of rolling boiled eggs
  downhill on Soul Cake Tuesday, but –'"

  It is in fact a Lithuanian tradition (one of many) to roll boiled eggs
  downhill on Easter Sunday in a game similar to lawn bowls. The idea is to
  either (1) break the other person's egg, thereby eliminating them from
  the competition (although this can be risky, since your own egg may also
  break) or (2) to get your egg to just hit someone else's, in which case
  you win their egg. Similar traditions undoubtedly exist in many other
  European countries (in fact, I'm told it is also done in some English
  villages), though not in the Netherlands, where we'd be having extreme
  difficulties finding a spot high enough for an egg to be rolled down from
  in the first place.

  This the first mention in the Discworld books of Soul Cake *Tuesday* (see
  also the annotation for p. 289/262 of "`Guards! Guards!`_"). Perhaps Terry
  finally settled on this day of the week because of the resonance with the
  traditional 'Pancake Tuesday' (the first Tuesday after Lent).

- [p. 193/140] "Even these people would consider it tactless to mention the
  word 'billygoat' to a troll."

  This sentence used to have me completely stumped, until I discovered
  (with the help of the ever helpful alt.fan.pratchett correspondents) that
  this refers to a well-known British fairy tale of Scandinavian origin
  called 'The Three Billygoats Gruff'.

  That tale tells the story of three billygoat brothers who try to cross a
  bridge guarded by, you guessed it, a mean troll who wants to eat them.
  Luckily, the troll wasn't very smart, so the first two goats were able to
  outwit him by passing him one at a time, each saying "Don't eat me, just
  wait for my brother who's much bigger and fatter than I am". The third
  goat, Big Billygoat Gruff, was big, all right. Big enough to take on the
  troll and butt him off the bridge and right over the mountains far from
  the green meadow (loud cheers from listening audience). So the troll was
  both tricked and trounced.

- [p. 204/147] "'I'll be as rich as Creosote.'"

  Creosote = Croesus. See the annotation for p. 125/113 of "Sourcery_".

- [p. 216/156] "'All the hort mond are here,' Nanny observed [...]"

  Hort mond = haut monde = high society.

- [p. 226/162] "'And there's this damn cat they've discovered that you can
  put in a box and it's dead and alive at the same time. Or something.'"

  This is Schroedinger's cat. See also the annotation for p. 279/199.

+ [p. ???/171] "'I was young and foolish then.' 'Well? You're old and
  foolish now.'"

  More people than I can count have written, in the light of Terry's
  fondness for They Might Be Giants, pointing out their song 'I Lost My
  Lucky Ball and Chain':

    |   She threw away her baby-doll
    |   I held on to my pride
    |   But I was young and foolish then
    |   I feel old and foolish now

- [p. 239/172] "This made some of the _grand guignol`_" melodramas a little
  unusual, [...]"

  Grand guignol, after the Montmartre, Paris theatre **Le Grand Guignol**, is
  the name given to a form of gory and macabre drama so laboriously
  horrific as to fall into absurdity.

- [p. 243/175] "'Mind you, that bramble jam tasted of fish, to my mind.' 'S
  caviar,' murmured Casanunda."

  Many people recognised this joke, and mentioned a variety of different
  sources. Terry replied: "It's very, very old. I first heard it from
  another journalist about 25 years ago, and he said he heard it on the
  (wartime) radio when he was a kid. I've also been told it is a music-hall
  line."

- [p. 248/178] "Quite a lot of trouble had once been caused in Unseen
  University by a former Archchancellor's hat, [...]"

  Refers back to certain events described more fully in "Sourcery_".

- [p. 250/180] **Jane's All The World Siege Weapons**

  **Jane's** is a well known series of books/catalogues for military
  equipment of all sorts and types. There is a Jane's for aeroplanes, for
  boats, etc.

- [p. 276/199] "[...] in this case there were three determinate states the
  cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious."

  This is a reference to the well-known 'Schroedinger's cat' quantum theory
  thought-experiment in which a cat in a box is probabilistically killed,
  leaving it in a superposition of being alive and being dead until the box
  is opened and the wavefunction collapses.

- [p. 276/199] "Shawn dived sideways as Greebo went off like a Claymore
  mine."

  A Claymore mine is an ingenious and therefore extremely nasty device. It
  is a small metal box, slightly curved. On the convex side is written
  "THIS SIDE TOWARDS THE ENEMY" which explains why literacy is a survival
  trait even with US marines. The box is filled with explosive and 600
  steel balls. It has a tripod and a trigger mechanism, which can be
  operated either by a tripwire or, when the operator doesn't want to miss
  the fun, manually. When triggered, the device explodes and showers the
  half of the world which could have read the letters with the steel balls.
  Killing radius 100 ft., serious maiming radius a good deal more. Used to
  great effect in Vietnam by both sides.

- [p. 277/199] "Green-blue blood was streaming from a dozen wounds [...]"

  This is a brilliant bit of logical extrapolation on Terry's part. Since
  iron is anathema to elves, they obviously can't have haemoglobin-based
  red blood. Copper-based (green) blood is used by some Earth animals,
  notably crayfish, so it's an obvious alternative. Of course, it was **Star
  Trek** that really made pointy-eared, green-blooded characters famous...

- [p. 285/205] "'This girl had her fiance stolen by the Queen of Elves and
  she didn't hang around whining, [...]'"

  A reference to the folk song 'Tam Lin', in which Fair Janet successfully
  wrests her Tam Lin from the Queen of Fairies, despite various alarming
  transformations inflicted on him.

- [p. 285/205] "'I'll be back.'"

  Catchphrase used by Arnold Schwarzenegger in (almost) all his movies.

- [p. 287/207] "Ancient fragments chimed together now in Magrat's head."

  The six lines given make up three different poems. From **The Fairies**, by
  Irish poet William Allingham (1850):

    |   Up the airy mountain, down the rushy glen
    |   We dare not go a-hunting for fear of little men

  From a traditional Cornish prayer:

    |   From ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggety beasties
    |   and things that go bump in the night
    |   Good Lord deliver us

  And finally from a traditional school girls' skipping rhyme:

    |   My mother said I never should
    |   Play with the fairies in the wood
    |   If I did, she would say
    |   You naughty girl to disobey
    |   Your hair won't grow, your shoes won't shine
    |   You naughty little girl, you shan't be mine!

- [p. 295/213] "'[...] one and six, beetle crushers! [...] one, two,
  forward... bean setting!'"

  This section demonstrates that Terry is not a Morris dancer himself; the
  terminology isn't quite authentic enough. But "beetle crushers" is an
  actual Morris step, and "bean setting" is the name of a dance and, by
  extension, a name for a move used in that dance.

- [p. 298/215] "'Girls used to go up there if they wanted to get –'"

  Women who wished to conceive would spend the night on the um, appropriate
  bit of the Cerne Abbas Giant site in Dorset. See the annotation for p.
  302/217.

- [p. 300/216] "[...] the only other one ever flying around here is Mr
  Ixolite the banshee, and he's very good about slipping us a note under
  the door when he's going to be about."

  If you haven't read "`Reaper Man`_" yet, you may not realise that the reason
  why Mr Ixolite slips notes under the door is that he is the only banshee
  in the world with a speech impediment.

- [p. 302/217] "'They're nervy of going close to the Long Man. [...] Here
  it's the landscape saying: I've got a great big tonker.'"

  The Discworld's Long Man is a set of three burial mounds. In Britain
  there is a famous monument called the Long Man of Wilmington, in East
  Sussex. It's not a mound, but a chalk-cut figure on a hillside; the turf
  was scraped away to expose the chalk underneath, outlining a standing
  giant 70 meters tall. There are several such figures in England, but only
  two human figures, this and the Cerne Abbas Giant.

  Chalk-cut figures have to be recut periodically, which provides
  opportunities to bowdlerize them. This is probably why the Long Man of
  Wilmington is sexless; it was recut in the 1870s, when, presumably,
  public displays of great big tonkers were rather frowned upon. However,
  the other chalk-cut giant in Britain, the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, is
  a nude, 55-meter-tall giant wielding a club, who has a tonker about 12
  meters long, and proudly upraised. Nearby is a small earth enclosure
  where maypole dancing, etc. was once held.

- [p. 305/219] "They showed a figure of an owl-eyed man wearing an animal
  skin and horns."

  I am told this description applies to the cave painting known as The
  Sorceror (aka The Magician, aka The Shaman) in the Trois Freres cave in
  Arieges, France.

- [p. 305/219] "There was a runic inscription underneath. [...] 'It's a
  variant of Oggham,' she said."

  Ogham is the name of an existing runic script found in the British Isles
  (mostly in Ireland) and dating back at least to the 5th century. The
  Pratchett Archives contain a file with more information about the oghamic
  alphabet, including pictures of the individual characters.

- [p. 307/221] "'Hiho, hiho –'"

  See the annotation for p. 88/73 of "`Moving Pictures`_".

- [p. 308/222] "'It's some old king and his warriors [...] supposed to wake
  up for some final battle when a wolf eats the sun.'"

  Another one of Terry's famous Mixed Legends along the lines of the
  princess and the pea fairy tale in "Mort_".

  The wolf bit is straight from Norse mythology. The wolf Fenris, one of
  Loki's monster children, will one day break free from his chains and eat
  the sun. This is one of the signs that the Goetterdaemmerung or Ragnarok
  has begun, and at this point the frost giants <<Who presumably have
  *still* not returned the Gods' lawnmower>> will cross the Rainbow Bridge
  and fight the final battle with the gods of Asgard and the heroes who
  have died and gone to Valhalla. See the last part of Richard Wagner's
  Ring cycle for details.

  The sleeping king is one of the oldest and deepest folk-myths of western
  culture, some versions of the popular legend even have King Arthur and
  his warriors sleeping on the island of Anglesea. For more information,
  see e.g. the section about the Fisher King in Frazer's **The Golden
  Bough**, Jessie Weston's **From Ritual To Romance** and all the stuff that
  this leads into, such as Elliot's **The Wasteland** and David Lodge's
  **Small World**.

- [p. 316/227] "The place looked as though it had been visited by Genghiz
  Cohen."

  Much later, in "`Interesting Times`_", we learn that Cohen the Barbarian's
  first name is, in fact, Genghiz.

  With respect to the original pun on Genghiz Kahn, Terry says:

  "As a matter of interest, I'm told there's a kosher Mongolian restaurant
  in LA called Genghiz Cohen's. It's a fairly obvious pun, if your mind is
  wired that way."

- [p. 316/227] "Queen Ynci wouldn't have obeyed..."

  The ancient warrior queen Ynci is modelled on Boadicea (who led a British
  rebellion against the Romans). Boadicea's husband was the ruler of a
  tribe called the Iceni, which is almost Ynci backwards.

- [p. 321/231] "...I think at some point I remember someone asking us to
  clap our hands..."

  From J. M. Barrie's **Peter Pan**:

  [...] [Tinkerbell the Fairy] was saying that she thought she could get
  well again if children believed in fairies. [...] "If you believe,"
  [Peter Pan] shouted to them, "clap your hands; don't let Tink die."

- [p. 324/233] "'Millennium hand and shrimp.'"

  One of the truly frequently asked questions on alt.fan.pratchett is
  "Where does this phrase come from?" (Foul Ole Ron also uses it, in "`Soul
  Music`_".)

  The answer concerns Terry's experiments with computer-generated texts:

  "It was a program called Babble, or something similar. I put in all kinds
  of stuff, including the menu of the Dragon House Chinese take-away
  because it was lying on my desk. The program attempted to make 'coherent'
  phrases (!) out of it all."

  One of the other things Terry must have fed it were the lyrics to the
  song 'Particle Man' by They Might Be Giants (see the annotation for p.
  264/199 of "`Soul Music`_"):

    |   Universe man, universe man
    |   Size of the entire universe man
    |   Usually kind to smaller men, universe man
    |   He's got a watch with a minute hand
    |   A millennium hand, and an eon hand
    |   When they meet it's happyland
    |   Powerful man, universe man.

- [p. 328/236] "'I've got five years' worth of **Bows And Ammo**, Mum,' said
  Shawn."

  In our world there is a magazine **Guns And Ammo**; this appears to be the
  Discworld equivalent.

- [p. 328/236] Shawn's speech.

  Shawn's speech is a parody of the 'St Crispin's Day' speech in
  Shakespeare's **King Henry V**. See also the annotation for p. 239/303 of
  "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 329/236] "[...] imitate the action of the Lancre Reciprocating Fox
  and stiffen some sinews while leaving them flexible enough [...]"

  And this one is from the even more famous 'Once more unto the breach'
  speech, also from **King Henry V**:

      "Then imitate the action of the tiger; stiffen the sinews, summon up
      the blood."

- [p. 341/245] "'Ain't that so, Fairy Peaseblossom?'"

  One of the fairies in **A Midsummer Night's Dream** is called Peasblossom.
  In itself this is not very interesting, but it is directly relevant when
  you consider the point Granny is trying to make to the Elf Queen.

- [p. 350/252] "The King held out a hand, and said something. Only Magrat
  heard it. Something about meeting by moonlight, she said later."

  In **A Midsummer Night's Dream** (act 2, scene 2), Oberon, King of the
  Fairies, says to Titania, Queen of the Fairies (with whom he has a kind
  of love/hate relationship): "Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania".

- [p. 353/253] "'You know, sir, sometimes I think there's a great ocean of
  truth out there and I'm just sitting on the beach playing with... with
  *stones*.'"

  This paraphrases Isaac Newton. The original quote can be found in
  Brewster's **Memoirs of Newton**, Volume II, Chapter 27:

  "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to
  have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself
  in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than
  ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before
  me."

- [p. 363/261] "'Go ahead, [...] bake my quiche.'"

  Clint Eastwood's **Dirty Harry** again, another satire of the line which
  also inspired "FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC" (see the annotation for p. 51/48 of
  "`Guards! Guards!`_").

- [p. 364/261] "'On with the motley. Magrat'll appreciate it.'"

  "On with the motley" is a direct translation of the Italian "Vesti la
  giubba" which is the first line of a famous aria from the opera **I
  Pagliacci**. (Operatic arias are usually known by their first line or
  first few words). It is the bitter aria in which the actor Canio laments
  that he must go on stage even though his heart is breaking, and climaxes
  with the line 'Ridi Pagliaccio'.

- [p. 367/264] "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, especially simian
  ones. They are not all that subtle."

  Definitely a Tolkien reference this time. See the annotation for p.
  183/149 of "Mort_".

  There is a version frequently seen on the net in people's .signatures,
  which I am sure will have Terry's full approval. It runs: "Do not meddle
  in the affairs of cats, for they are subtle and will piss on your
  computer".

- [p. 371/267] "'My great-grandma's husband hammered it out of a tin bath
  and a couple of saucepans.'"

  On a.f.p. the question was asked why, if Magrat's armour was fake and not
  made of iron at all, was it so effective against the Elves? Terry
  answers:

  "A tin bath isn't made out of tin. It's invariably galvanised iron – ie,
  zinc dipped. They certainly rust after a while."

- [p. 382/274] "[...] he called it **The Taming Of The Vole** [...]"

  Shakespeare again, of course. A vole is a small animal, somewhat similar
  to a shrew.
