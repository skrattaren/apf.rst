Wyrd Sisters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [title] "`Wyrd Sisters`_"

  In **Macbeth**, the three witches are sometimes called the weird sisters,
  e.g. act 2, scene 1: (Banquo) "I dreamt last night of the three weird
  sisters [...]"; or act 4, scene 1: (Macbeth) "Saw you the weird sisters?"
  (Lennox) "No, my lord."

  But there's a bit more to it than just the Macbeth reference. 'Wyrd' is
  the Norse concept of destiny or fate, as embodied by the Norns (who
  probably inspired the Witches in **Macbeth**). Since 'weird' to a modern
  reader just means 'strange', it's easy to miss the overtones of the title
  and just assume that it's an Old spelling of 'weird'.

- [p. 5/5] "'When shall we three meet again?'"

  **Macbeth**, act 1, scene 1, first line. The entire opening scene of "`Wyrd
  Sisters`_" is of course a direct parody on the opening scene of **Macbeth**.

- [p. 5/5] "Gods prefer simple, vicious games, where you Do Not Achieve
  Transcendence but Go Straight To Oblivion; [...]"

  Probably the most famous Chance (or Community Chest) card in Monopoly:
  "GO TO JAIL – Go directly to Jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect
  $200.". (or 200 pounds, or 200 guilders, or 200 of whatever currency you
  care to name).

- [p. 7/7] "The junior witch, whose name was Magrat Garlick, relaxed
  considerably."

  Terry says: "Magrat is pronounced Magg-rat. Doesn't matter what I think
  is right – *everyone* I've heard pronounce it has pronounced it
  Maggrat."

  "In Margaret Murray's book "The Witch Cult in Western Europe" you will
  find a number of Magrats and Magrets, and a suggestion that they were not
  misspellings but an earlier form of Margaret; also in the lists of those
  arraigned for witchcraft are the surnames Garlick, Device and Nutter. No
  Oggs or Weatherwax's, though."

- [p. 8/8] "Meanwhile King Verence, monarch of Lancre, was making a
  discovery."

  There exists a book entitled **Servants of Satan**, which is about the
  history of witch hunts. It contains the following paragraph:

  "This brings us back to Pierre de Lancre. He became convinced that Basque
  women where an immoral and unfaithful lot when observing their social
  arrangements during his witch-hunting expedition. De Lancre was
  especially horrified at the leadership roles in religious services taken
  by Basque women, the very women among whom witchcraft was rife..."

  Terry comments: "I'm astonished. I've never heard of the guy, and I'm
  reasonably well-read in that area. But it *is* a lovely coincidence."

  It may also not be entirely a coincidence that 'Lancre' is a common way
  of referring to Lancashire, the county where the famous 17th century
  witch trials were held (see the annotation for p. 78/57 of "`Lords and
  Ladies`_").

- [p. 11/10] "NO PREMONITIONS? STRANGE DREAMS? MAD OLD SOOTHSAYERS SHOUTING
  THINGS AT YOU IN THE STREET?"

  Refers to the famous "Beware the ides of March" warning in Shakespeare's
  **Julius Caesar**, act 1, scene 2.

- [p. 14/14] "'Can you tell by the pricking of your thumbs?' said Magrat
  earnestly."

  **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1: (2 Witch) *'By the pricking of my thumbs,
  Something wicked this way comes [...]'*.

  Keep an eye on **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1. It's one of Terry's favourites
  in "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 19/19] "Duke Felmet stared out gloomily at the dripping forest."

  Felmet's dislike of the forest resonates with the prophecy foretelling
  Macbeth had nothing to fear until Birnam wood itself would march against
  him.

- [p. 20/20] "There had been something about him being half a man, and...
  infirm on purpose?"

  Infirm *of* purpose, is what Lady Macbeth calls her husband in **Macbeth**,
  act 2, scene 2.

- [p. 20/20] "[...] with nothing much to do but hunt, drink and exercise
  his droit de seigneur."

  'Droit de seigneur' or 'jus primae noctae' ('right of first night'): a
  custom alleged to have existed in medieval Europe giving the lord of the
  land the right to sleep the first night with the bride of any one of his
  vassals. The evidence for this custom deals with redemption dues which
  were paid to avoid its enforcement. It probably existed as a recognised
  custom in parts of France and possibly Italy and Germany, but not
  elsewhere.

- [p. 22/21] "[...] an architect who had heard about Gormenghast but hadn't
  got the budget."

  Gormenghast is the ancient, decaying castle from Mervyn Peake's
  **Gormenghast** trilogy. See also the annotation for p. 17/17 of
  "Pyramids_".

- [p. 22/22] "'There is a knocking without,' he said."

  In act 2 of **Macbeth**, scenes 2 and 3 have a lot of [Knocking within] in
  the stage directions.

- [p. 25/25] "'How many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest
  depths of the ocean and then, when you get home and have a nice bit of
  turbot for your tea, there it is?'"

  Nanny's ring story is a well-known folk tale that goes back as least as
  far as Herodotus, but has also been used by e.g. Tolkien and Jack Vance.

  More interesting is that at least one non-Brit over on alt.fan.pratchett
  had some trouble making sense of the implied connection between the
  concepts of 'turbot' and 'tea'. What he did not realise was that 'tea' is
  the term the British tend to use for any meal taken between 4.30 and 7
  pm, which may therefore include a nice, juicy turbot.

- [p. 26/26] "'You'd have to be a born fool to be a king,' said Granny."

  I must have read "`Wyrd Sisters`_" close to twenty times by now, and except
  for the last time this nice bit of foreshadowing completely passed me by.

- [p. 30/30] "'All the women are played by men.'"

  For those who do not know: in Shakespeare's time this was indeed the
  case; no women were allowed on stage.

- [p. 35/35] "He'd tried to wash the blood off his hand."

  Obvious, because very well known, but since I'm annotating all the other
  Shakespeare references, I might as well point out here that Felmet's
  attempts to wash the blood from his hands echo Lady Macbeth's actions in
  **Macbeth** after the killing of Duncan in act 5, scene 1: "Out, damned
  spot!", etc.

- [p. 36/35] **The Hedgehog Can Never Be Buggered At All**

  Terry invented this title; he has *not* written any words to it (apart
  from the fragments that appear in the novels); but many fans (including a
  folk singer called Heather Wood) have; and there *did* turn out to exist
  an old Oxford drinking song that also uses the key phrase of the hedgehog
  song. See the "`Song...`_" section in Chapter 5 for one documented version
  of that song. Terry pleads parallel evolution, and observes that: "There
  is a certain, how shall I put it, natural cadence to the words."

  Readers of alt.fan.pratchett have also engaged in a collective
  songwriting effort, the results of which can be found in the Pratchett
  Archives (see Chapter 6 for details), in the file
  /pub/pratchett/misc/hedgehog-song. See also Chapter 5 for a sample.

- [p. 50/49] "Nanny Ogg also kept a cat, a huge one-eyed grey tom called
  Greebo [...]"

  'Greebo' is a word that was widely used in the early seventies to
  describe the sort of man who wanders around in oil-covered denim and
  leather (with similar long hair) and who settles disagreements with a
  motorcycle chain – the sort who would like to be a Hell's Angel but
  doesn't have enough style.

- [p. 50/50] "'Well met by moonlight,' said Magrat politely. 'Merry meet. A
  star shines on –'"

  Magrat's first greeting comes from **A Midsummer Night's Dream**: "Ill met
  by moonlight, proud Titania". See also the annotation for p. 350/252 of "`Lords
  and Ladies`_".

  From Tolkien's **The Lord of the Rings** comes the Elvish greeting: "A star
  shines on the hour of our meeting".

- [p. 53/53] "'Every inch a king,' said Granny."

  A quote from **King Lear**, act 4, scene 6.

- [p. 58/58] "'**A Wizard of Sorts**,' Vitoller read. '**Or, Please
  Yourself**.'"

  Not quite a Shakespeare title, but **Please Yourself** refers to both **As
  You Like It** and the subtitle of **Twelfth Night**: "Or What You Will".

- [p. 60/60] "It was the cats and the roller skates that were currently
  giving him trouble..."

  Refers to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals **Cats** and **Starlight
  Express**.

- [p. 61/60] "However, in Bad Ass a cockerel laid an egg and had to put up
  with some very embarrassing personal questions."

  Legend has it that from an egg laid by a cockerel and hatched by a
  serpent, a cockatrice (also known as a basilisk) will spawn. Since the
  cockatrice is a monster with the wings of a fowl, the tail of a dragon,
  and the head of a cock, whose very look causes instant death, it should
  be clear that such an egg would be a very bad omen indeed.

- [p. 65/65] "'Is this a dagger I see before me?' he mumbled."

  From what is probably the most famous soliloquy in **Macbeth**: act 2,
  scene 1. See also the annotation for p. 184/183.

- [p. 68/67] "The stone was about the same height as a tall man, [...]"

  This is a reference to the Rollright stones near Chipping Norton in the
  UK, which according to legend can not be accurately counted.

- [p. 75/74] "A faint glow beyond the frosted panes suggested that, against
  all reason, a new day would soon dawn."

  The first scene of the first act of Shakespeare's **Hamlet** starts at
  midnight, and describes a scene lasting about fifteen minutes – yet the
  act ends at dawn. Likewise, the summoning of WxrtHltl-jwlpklz the demon
  takes place at night, but ends with the quote given above.

+ [p. 82] "[...] the Twins, toddling hand in hand along the midnight
  corridors, [...]"

  The same image can also be found in Stanley Kubrick's classic horror
  movie **The Shining**, where the ghosts of two small girl twins (who
  were horribly murdered in a 'dark deed') walk handin hand through the
  corridors of the Overlook Hotel.

- [p. 84/83] "[...] its eyes two yellow slits of easy-going malevolence
  [...]"

  In earlier editions of the APF this was flagged as one of Terry's major
  inconsistencies. After all, Greebo is supposed to have only *one* eye.

  But since then, Terry has explained on a.f.p: "Greebo is loosely modelled
  on a real cat I knew when I was a kid – he had two eyes, but one was
  sort of pearly coloured. He's *blind* in one eye."

- [p. 88/87] "Magrat was picking flowers and talking to them."

  What follows is a satire of the mad Ophelia in **Hamlet**: "There's
  rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is
  pansies, that's for thoughts." (act 4, scene 5).

- [p. 95/94] "It's all very well calling for eye of newt, but do you mean
  Common, Spotted or Great Crested?"

  Eye of Newt is one of the ingredients used by the witches in **Macbeth**,
  act 4, scene 1.

  This scene also resonates very faintly with the famous running gag in the
  movie **Monty Python and the Holy Grail**:

      Bridgekeeper:
            "What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
      Arthur:
            "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?"
      Bridgekeeper:
            "Huh? I – I don't know that! Auuuuuuuugh!"

- [p. 103/103] "[...] (a dandelion clock at about 2 pm)."

  For an explanation of the dandelion clock see the annotation for p. 10/10
  of "`The Light Fantastic`_".

- [p. 108/107] "'Infirm of purpose!'"

  Lady Macbeth says this in **Macbeth**, act 2, scene 2.

- [p. 108/108] "'[...] and *you* said, "If it's to be done, it's better if
  it's done quickly", or something [...]'"

  **Macbeth**, act 1, scene 7: "If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere
  well it were done quickly."

- [p. 109/108] "Granny glanced around the dungeon."

  This is another misprint: it should be Nanny, not Granny. Terry says the
  error is not present in his own version of the text, but both the UK and
  USA paperbacks have it.

- [p. 127/126] "'[...] the land and the king are one.'"

  A concept straight out of the Arthurian legends.

- [p. 128/127] "[...] rose from the ditch like Venus Anadyomene, only older
  and with more duckweed."

  Venus Anadyomene is the classical image of Venus rising from the sea
  (from which she was born), accompanied by dolphins. The name is given to
  the famous lost painting by Apelles, as well as to the one by Botticelli
  in the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Florence.

- [p. 133/132] "'I have no recollection of it at this time,' he murmured."

  Duke Felmet is echoing the words of Richard Nixon's subordinates under
  questioning by the Senate Committee during the Watergate affair.

- [p. 134/133] "[...] whirl a farmhouse to any available emerald city of
  its choice."

  A **Wizard of Oz** reference.

- [p. 139/138] "'I mean, Black Aliss was one of the best.'"

  My sources tell me that Black Annis is the name of a fearsome witch from
  Celtic/Saxon mythology.

- [p. 142/141] "Greebo's grin gradually faded, until there was nothing left
  but the cat. This was nearly as spooky as the other way round."

  Refers to the Cheshire cat in Lewis Carroll's **Alice's Adventures in
  Wonderland**, a beast famous for slowly vanishing until only its grin
  remains.

- [p. 145/144] "[...] Herne the Hunted, the terrified and apprehensive
  deity of all small furry creatures [...]"

  Herne the Hun*ter* is a spectral hunter of medieval legend, said to
  originally have been a keeper in Windsor Forest. Herne appears in many
  stories, varying from Shakespeare (who else) to the fairly recent ITV
  television series "Robin of Sherwood" (starring Jason "son of" Connery).

  When alt.fan.pratchett readers mistakenly assumed that the reference
  *originated* from this series, Terry cautioned: "Be careful when
  reference spotting... Herne the Hunter certainly did turn up in the Robin
  of Sherwood series and on an album by "Let's breathe romantically to
  music" group Clannad, but any passing pagan will tell you he goes back a
  lot, lot further than that."

  Herne the Hunter also appears himself in "`Lords and Ladies`_". Here is some
  relevant information condensed from the book **The Western Way** by John
  and Caitlin Matthews:

  "Herne the Hunter / Cernunnos is God of green and growing things;
  huntsman, spirit of earth, birth and masculinity. Often pictured seated
  cross-legged with antlers on his brow, he is [...] tutelary deity of many
  modern witch covens."

- [p. 156/155] "[...] trying to find a laboratory opposite a dress shop
  that will keep the same dummy in the window for sixty years, [...]"

  This refers to the 1960 movie version of H. G. Wells' **The Time Machine**,
  where the director uses the effect described to indicate the rapid
  passing of time.

- [p. 158/158] "He'd sorted out the falling chandelier, and found a place
  for a villain who wore a mask to conceal his disfigurement, [...]"

  Describes **The Phantom of the Opera**, another musical by Andrew Lloyd
  Webber. See also the annotations for "Maskerade_".

- [p. 159/158] "[...] the hero had been born in a handbag."

  The protagonist in Oscar Wilde's **The Importance of Being Earnest** was
  found, as a baby, in a handbag.

- [p. 159/158] "It was the clowns who were giving him trouble again."

  The clowns are the Marx Brothers. The third clown is Harpo, who never
  speaks, only honks ("business with bladder on a stick"). The short speech
  that follows, "This iss My Little Study..." is typical Groucho, and the
  "Atsa right, Boss" is Chico.

- [p. 159/158] "**Thys ys amain Dainty Messe youe have got me into,
  Stanleigh**"

  Laurel & Hardy. Laurel's first name was Stan. See also the annotation for
  p. 73/65 of "`The Colour of Magic`_".

- [p. 160/159] The Dysk.

  The famous Globe Theatre (which was octagonal in form!) was built by
  Cuthbert Barbage on the Bankside in Southwark (London) in 1599.
  Shakespeare had a share in the theatre and acted there.

  The Globe was destroyed by fire, rebuilt, and eventually completely
  demolished in 1644. Currently, The Globe is being rebuilt again by an
  American entrepreneur on the South Bank, a few hundred yards from its
  original site.

- [p. 162/161] "*All the disk is but an Theater*, he wrote, *Ane alle men
  and wymmen are but Players*. [...] *Sometimes they walke on. Sometimes
  they walke off*."

  **As You Like It**, act 2, scene 7: "All the world's a stage, And all the
  men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances;
  [...]"

- [p. 163/162] "I had this dream about a little bandy-legged man walking
  down a road."

  I have resisted annotating this for 7 editions of the APF, but oh what
  the heck: Hwel is dreaming of Charlie Chaplin.

- [p. 165/164] "'I *said*, where's your pointy hat, dopey?'"

  Dopey is one of the seven dwarfs in Walt Disney's animated **Snow White**.
  Terry likes toying with Disney's dwarf names. See for instance the
  annotation for p. 324/271 of "`Moving Pictures`_".

- [p. 167/166] "'Brothers! And yet may I call all men brother, for on this
  night –'"

  This is (in spirit) the St Crispin's Day speech from **King Henry V**. See
  the annotation for p. 239/238.

- [p. 182/181] "Double hubble, stubble trouble, Fire burn and cauldron
  bub---"

  The witches in **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1: "Double, double toil and
  trouble; Fire, burn; and, cauldron, bubble."

- [p. 169/168] "[...] go around with axes in their belts, and call
  themselves names like Timkin Rumbleguts."

  This is a sarcastic comment on the behaviour of most generic fantasy
  dwarfs, but of course the main image it invokes is of classic Tolkien
  characters like Thorin Oakenshield, etc.

- [p. 173/172] "'We've got a special on GBH this season.'"

  The abbreviation GBH stands for Grievous Bodily Harm.

- [p. 178/177] "The pay's the thing."

  Puns on a well-known Shakespeare quote from **Hamlet** (act 2, scene 2):

    |   The play's the thing
    |   Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king

  If you have access to the Internet, you can find online versions of all
  of Shakespeare's plays at the URL:

  <http://shakespeare.mit.edu/>

- [p. 179/178] "'I've got this idea about this ship wrecked on an island,
  where there's this--'"

  This can of course refer to a thousand different movies or plays. In view
  of the general influences for this book, however, I'd bet my money on
  Shakespeare's **The Tempest**.

- [p. 181/180] "*Round about the cauldron go*, [...]"

  What follows is a parody on **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1, in which three
  witches boil up some pretty disgusting things in their cauldron. Try
  reading both versions side by side.

- [p. 182/181] "He punched the rock-hard pillow, and sank into a fitful
  sleep. Perchance to dream."

  Taken from the famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy in **Hamlet**.

- [p. 183/182] "KING: Now if I could just find my horsey..."

  Hwel's script is **Richard III** done as a Punch-and-Judy show.

- [p. 184/183] "Is this a duck I see before me, its beak pointing at me?"

  **Macbeth**, act 2, scene 1 again. See the annotation for p. 65/65.

- [p. 186/185] "Leonard of Quirm. He's a painter, really."

  Refers to Leonardo da Vinci, who also worked on (but didn't succeed in
  building) a flying machine.

- [p. 186/185] "We grow old, Master Hwel. [...] We have heard the gongs at
  midnight."

  Shakespeare again: **King Henry IV, part 2**, act 3, scene 2:

  "FALSTAFF: Old, old, Master Shallow. [...] We have heard the chimes at
  midnight, Master Shallow."

- [p. 189/188] "'There's many a slip twixt dress and drawers.'"

  A Nanny Ogg variant on the saying "There's many a slip 'tween the cup and
  the lip" ('slip' here meaning 'petticoat').

- [p. 189/188] "'A week is a long time in magic,' said Nanny."

  Sir Harold Wilson: "A week is a long time in politics".

- [p. 193/192] "1ST WITCHE: He's late. (Pause)" [Etc.]

  Parodies Samuel Beckett's classic play **Waiting for Godot**, where similar
  dialogue occurs.

- [p. 199/198] "'Did you know that an adult male carries up to five pounds
  of undigested red meat in his intestines at all times?"

  Stereotypical (but basically true) propaganda that radical vegetarians
  like to quote in order to gross people out and get them to stop eating
  meat (of course, the average vegetarian has about five pounds of
  undigested vegetable matter in his intestines). The cliche is used fairly
  often, amongst other places in the movie **Beverly Hills Cop**.

  Terry had this to say on the subject: "Yep. That one I got from some way
  out vegetarian stuff I read years ago, and went round feeling ill about
  for days. And two years ago I saw **Beverly Hills Cop** on TV and rejoiced
  when I heard the line. God, I wish I'd seen the film before I'd written
  "`Guards! Guards!`_"... I'd have had someone out on stake-duty on horseback,
  and someone creep up behind them with a banana..."

  Note that in "`Men at Arms`_", the second City Watch book, Terry does manage
  to work in a **Beverly Hills Cop** joke. See the annotation for p. 251/190
  of "`Men At Arms`_".

- [p. 207/206] "'All hail wossname,' she said under her breath, 'who shall
  be king here, after.'"

  **Macbeth**, act 1, scene 2: "All hail, Macbeth; that shalt be king
  hereafter!"

- [p. 208/207] "'Is anyone sitting here?' he said."

  **Macbeth**, act 3, scene 4:

      Macbeth: 'The table's full.'
      Lennox: 'Here is a place reserv'd, sir.'
      Macbeth: 'Where?'

  Visible only to Macbeth the ghost of Banquo is sitting in his chair.

- [p. 211/210] "'We're scheming evil secret black and midnight hags!'"

  **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1: "How now, you secret, black, and midnight
  hags!" See also the annotation for p. 186/152 of "Mort_".

- [p. 212/211] "'I never shipwrecked anybody!' she said."

  Neither did the three witches from **Macbeth**, if you read carefully, but
  I nevertheless think there is a reference here: act 1, scene 3.

- [p. 213/212] "I'd like to know if I could compare you to a summer's day.
  Because – well, June 12th was quite nice, and ..."

  One of Shakespeare's more famous sonnets (Sonnet XVIII, to be precise)
  starts out:

    |   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    |   Thou art more lovely and more temperate

- [p. 213/212] "'But I never walked like that! Why's he got a hump on his
  back? What's happened to his leg?'"

  A reference to Richard the Third. A rather appropriate reference: in
  Shakespeare's **Richard III**, he is presented as an evil, lame,
  hunchbacked king, whom Henry must kill to save England. This is not
  historically correct – rather it is how Henry would have liked people to
  remember it. Had Shakespeare strayed from the 'official' version he would
  have found himself in deep trouble with Henry's heirs – royalty was
  taken seriously in those days.

- [p. 213/213] "'It's art,' said Nanny. 'It wossname, holds a mirror up to
  life.'"

  **Hamlet**, act 3, scene 2: "To hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature;
  to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and
  body of the time his form and pressure."

- [p. 214/213] "'Ditch-delivered by a drabe', they said."

  One of the ingredients in **Macbeth**, act 4, scene 1 is a "finger of
  birth-strangled babe, ditch-delivered by a drabe".

- [p. 225/225] "--THE NEXT NIGHT IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM THEY HANG A STAR--"

  Death is quoting from 'There's No Business Like Show Business', the song
  from the Irvin Berlin musical **Annie Get Your Gun**, also performed by
  Ethel Merman in the 1954 movie **There's No Business Like Show Business**.

- [p. 227/226] "'[...] who would have thought he had so much blood in
  him?'"

  Lady Macbeth in **Macbeth**, act 5, scene 1: "Yet who would have thought
  the old man to have had so much blood in him".

- [p. 235/234] "Like Bognor."

  Bognor Regis is a town on the south coast of England, between Brighton
  and Portsmouth. A sleepy seaside resort, it is best-known for King George
  V's attributed last words, supposedly said after his physician told him
  he would soon be brought to Bognor to convalesce: "Bugger Bognor!".

- [p. 236/235] "'Can you remember what he said after all those tomorrows?'"

  **Macbeth**, act 5, scene 5, from a another famous soliloquy:

    |   To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
    |   Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
    |   To the last syllable of recorded time;
    |   And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    |   The way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle!
    |   Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player
    |   That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
    |   And then is heard no more: it is a tale
    |   Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    |   Signifying nothing.

- [p. 239/238] "They were far more the type of kings who got people to
  charge into battle at five o'clock in the morning..."

  Shakespeare's Henry V was just such a king, and Terry is referring here
  to the 'St Crispin's Day' speech in **King Henry V**, act 4, scene 3:

    |   And gentlemen in England now a-bed
    |   Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
    |   And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
    |   That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
