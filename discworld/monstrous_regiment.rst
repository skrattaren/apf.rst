Monstrous Regiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ [title] **Monstrous Regiment**

  The title of this book is a reference to the pamphlet **The First Blast of
  the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women**, written by John
  Knox in 1558, complaining about the sudden appearance of female monarchs
  such as Elizabeth of England and Mary of Scotland pre-empting the natural
  position and authority of men.

+ [p. 9] "In Borogravia, [...]"

  The name 'Borogravia' invokes the made-up word 'borogove' (often
  misprinted as 'borogrove') from the poem 'Jabberwocky' in Lewis Carroll's
  **Through the Looking Glass**:

    |   Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    |   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    |   All mimsy were the borogoves,
    |   And the mome raths outgrabe.

  Carroll described borogoves as an extinct variety of wingless parrot with
  an upturned beak, which nested on sundials and lived on veal. Terry's
  dislike of the Alice books has been previously noted (see the "`Words From
  The Master`_" section).

+ [p. 13] "[...] if you had a billygoat."

  A reference to the "The Three Billygoats Gruff" fairy tale. See also the
  annotation for p. 193/140 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 14] "The songs had been part of her childhood."

  Many, if not all, of the songs listed here are actual folk songs. You can
  find the full lyrics using on-line resources such as the Digital
  Tradition Archive (<http://www.mudcat.org/>), but I'll reproduce a couple
  of verses here to give an indication of the flavour.

  Tradition says 'The World Turned Upside Down' was played at Cornwallis'
  surrender to Washington during the American Revolution:

    |   If buttercups buzz'd after the bee,
    |   If boats were on land, churches on sea,
    |   If ponies rode men and if grass ate the cows,
    |   And cats should be chased into holes by the mouse,

    |   If the mamas sold their babies
    |   To the gypsies for half a crown;
    |   If summer were spring and the other way round,
    |   Then all the world would be upside down.

  'The Devil Shall Be My Sergeant' (known as 'Rogue's March'):

    |   I left my home and I left my job
    |   Went and joined the army
    |   If I knew then what I know now
    |   I wouldn't have been so barmy.

    |   Poor old soldier, poor old soldier
    |   If I knew then what I know now
    |   I wouldn't have been so barmy.

    |   [...]

    |   Fifty I got for selling me coat
    |   Fifty for me blankets
    |   If ever I 'list for a soldier again
    |   The devil shall be me sergeant.

  'Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier' (also known as 'Shule Agra', which is
  badly anglicised Irish for "Walk, My Love"):

    |   With fife and drum he marched away
    |   He would not heed what I did say
    |   He'll not come back for many a day
    |   Johnny has gone for a soldier

    |   Shule shule shule shule agra
    |   Sure a sure and he loves me
    |   When he comes back he'll marry me
    |   Johnny has gone for a soldier

  'The Girl I Left Behind Me' (many versions exist):

    |   I'm lonesome since I cross'd the hills,
    |   And o'er the moor that's sedgy;
    |   With heavy thoughts my mind is fill'd,
    |   Since I parted with my Naggy
    |   When e'er I return to view the place,
    |   The tears doth fall and blind me,
    |   When I think on the charming grace
    |   Of the girl I left behind me.

  And finally, 'Sweet Polly Oliver' tells the story of a woman who dresses
  as a male soldier in order to follow her true love into the army:

    |   As sweet Polly Oliver lay musing in bed,
    |   A sudden strange fancy came into her head.
    |   'Nor father nor mother shall make me false prove,
    |   I'll 'list as a soldier, and follow my love.'

    |   So early next morning she softly arose,
    |   And dressed herself up in her dead brother's clothes.
    |   She cut her hair close, and she stained her face brown,
    |   And went for a soldier to fair London Town.

  I've not been able to find real-world equivalents yet for 'Colonel
  Crapski' and 'I Wish I'd Never Kissed Her' – any pointers will be most
  welcome.

+ [p. 15] "[...] the spanking red uniform [...]"

  The entire Borogravian army wears a standard red uniform. Both the
  uniform and its standardisation point to the Borogravian army being
  modelled on the English (later British) army, whose soldiers were clad in
  red for nearly 250 years from 1645 onward. Among many other armies, even
  those of major military powers, uniforms didn't truly become 'uniform'
  until as late as the First World War.

+ [p. 16] "'Give him the shilling, corporal.'"

  In the English army, taking the King's or Queen's Shilling was a ritual
  of induction; upon taking a shilling coin as enlistment bounty, the
  inductee was legally considered a soldier.

+ [p. 17] "*Awake!*"

  The Borogravian national anthem does not seem to parody any specific
  national anthem. However, the line "Awake, ye sons of the Motherland"
  echoes France's "Allons, enfants de la Patrie" ("come, children of the
  Fatherland"); while "Frustrate the endless wiles of our enemies" echoes
  the second verse of Britain's "God Save the Queen":

    |   O Lord our God, arise,
    |   Scatter our enemies,
    |   And make them fall;
    |   Confound their politics,
    |   Frustrate their knavish tricks;
    |   On thee our hopes we fix:
    |   God save us all.

  For what it's worth, very few national anthems start with 'awake',
  although many begin with 'arise'.

+ [p. 21] "'[...] the **Book of Nuggan**.'"

  We have seen Nuggan before, in "`The Last Hero`_". He is therein depicted as
  short and irritable; perhaps his stature indicates his demise is already
  underway.

+ [p. 25] "They're cutting the continent in half"

  "`The Discworld Mapp`_" shows that the location of Borogravia indeed falls
  neatly across Clacks lines between Ankh-Morpork and Genua.

+ [p. 28] "you can call me Maladict"

  The name is both a play on the name 'Benedict' and on the word
  'maledict', which Webster's defines as accursedness or the act of
  bringing a curse.

+ [p. 30] "'I, of course, don't drink... horse piss, [...]'"

  Terry loves to play with this famous Dracula "I don't drink... wine"
  line. See also the annotation for p. 54 of "`Carpe Jugulum`_".

+ [p. 32] "'Don't ask, don't tell.'"

  During the early 1990s, the United States military reexamined its
  long-standing prohibition on homosexuals serving in the armed forces.
  Social conservatives strongly opposed the change in policy; the
  compromise eventually reached, which persists to this writing (2004), was
  labelled "don't ask, don't tell"; the administration of the military was
  not allowed to ask a recruit or soldier his or her sexual orientation,
  but revealing it to be homosexual (or bisexual) was still grounds for
  discharge. The compromise was widely ridiculed by all sides.

+ [p. 34] "'[...] orders an Electrick Floorbanger, [...]'"

  Carborundum's drink contains silver and copper metal in some kind of
  acidic electrolyte. In such conditions, an electric current can be
  established between the silver and copper, acting as a primitive battery.

  The name 'Electric Floorbanger' also resonates with the Harvey
  Wallbanger, a classic 1970s cocktail made of vodka, Galliano and orange.

+ [p. 37] "[...] according to Father Jupe [...]"

  A running gag is that famous officers lend their names to articles of
  clothing. 'Jupe' is French for 'skirt'; possibly Father Jupe is a former
  military hero?

+ [p. 39] "'Well, it won't be in front of me for long.'"

  A quotation often attributed to George Bernard Shaw, although it may have
  originated with composer Max Reger: "I am in the smallest room of the
  house. I have your review in front of me. Soon it will be behind me."

+ [p. 39] "'Hands off – well, you lot wouldn't be able to find 'em...'"

  "Hands off cocks, on with socks!" is the traditional military wake-up
  shout (see also the annotation for p. 317/241 of "`Men At Arms`_"). Does it
  need pointing out that in this particular case, unbeknownst to Strappi,
  there are very *good* reasons why these soldiers wouldn't be able to
  "find 'em"...?

+ [p. 50] "[...] Strappi had written WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR and down the
  side he had written 1, 2, 3."

  From the Vietnam-era protest song 'I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die-Rag', by
  Country Joe & The Fish (famously performed at Woodstock):

    |   And it's one, two, three,
    |   What are we fighting for?
    |   Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
    |   Next stop is Vietnam;
    |   And it's five, six, seven,
    |   Open up the pearly gates,
    |   Well there ain't no time to wonder why,
    |   Whoopee! we're all gonna die.

+ [p. 68] "most of you will almost certainly be pikemen"

  Pikes are used defensively against cavalry charges, or offensively
  against infantry in the following fashion: a rank of pikemen advances on
  a rank of enemy infantry, pikes extended forward, and attempts to jab the
  enemy with their pikes; then draws swords and engages as standard
  infantry while the rank behind them advances with their pikes. The
  Borogravian pike may be the "tool formerly used for lifting beets"
  referred to in the National Anthem.

+ [p. 76] "*The Craft of War*"

  Sun Tzu's **The Art Of War** is the standard text of military philosophy.
  See also the annotation for p. 63 of "`Interesting Times`_".

+ [p. 85] "[...] a banknote [...]"

  Borogravia uses paper currency, while A-M still uses precious-metal
  coins. In a world where coin is the standard of exchange, a country
  operating on paper currency not backed by precious metal ("fiat money",
  in economic parlance) might see its economy become isolated from the rest
  of the world. The very fact that paper money is being issued indicates
  that Borogravia may have been strapped for hard cash for some time.

+ [p. 86] "One shilling extra 'per Diem'"

  Using this information and UK army pay scales, one can estimate that a
  second lieutenant in the Borogravian army receives approximately 1807
  shillings per year as payment, compared to 2012 shillings per year for a
  first lieutenant; and that there are approximately 11.16 Borogravian
  shillings to one UK pound.

  As my original afp source for this annotation puts it: "Working this out
  may be the single geekiest thing I have ever done."

+ [p. 90] "They wore dark-blue uniforms, [...]"

  The Zlobenian cavalry uniforms hearken to those of Prussia and of the
  United States during the late 19th century.

+ [p. 92] "*We have met the enemy and he is nice?*"

  The original quote is: "We have met the enemy and they are ours – two
  ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop", written by Oliver Hazard
  Perry in a Letter to General Harrison. after defeating the British at the
  battle of Lake Erie in a decisive victory.

  These days, however, the better known version is probably Walt Kelly's
  "We have met the enemy, and they are us", used in his classic comic strip
  **Pogo**, during the Vietnam years.

+ [p. 96] "'[...] you bloody beeteater, [...]'"

  Borogravians and Zlobenians derisively refer to each other as 'beeteater'
  and 'swede-eater'.

+ [p. 101] "'[...] temporary feelings of shock and awe, sir.'"

  "Shock and Awe" is the name of a military doctrine first coined by the
  USA in its 2003 invasion of Iraq, and immediately became a household
  phrase all over the world.

+ [p. 103] "'Oh damn', said Maladict"

  Maladict curses; a rather clever Tom Swiftie. (See the annotation for p.
  26/26 of "`The Light Fantastic`_".)

+ [p. 108] "Road to perdition"

  Albert Einstein: "The road to perdition has ever been accompanied by lip
  service to an ideal."

+ [p. 112] "'So you're not actually waylaying field reports from the
  **Times**, then, sir?' [...]"

  During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, both sides relied on television news
  for information; private journalists were often better-informed than
  military intelligence.

+ [p. 136] "I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill"

  From "The Girl I Left Behind Me"; see the annotation for p. 14.

+ [p. 143] "'[...] nothing I do in pursuit of my quest will be held
  Abominable.'"

  Soldiers who went on the Crusades were told that in undertaking the
  Crusade they would be absolved of all sins.

+ [p. 144] "'I am to take command of the Army,' said Wazzer."

  Jeanne d'Arc, aka Joan of Arc or St. Joan, led the French army against
  the English while dressed as a man, and believed she heard the voice of
  God.

+ [p. 151] "Jolly Sailor"

  The same tobacco seen in "`The Wee Free Men`_".

+ [p. 165] "Lord Rust's regiment"

  Lord Rust's style of command is described thoroughly in "Jingo_" and
  "`Night Watch`_".

+ [p. 166] "One, Two, Three! What We Are Fighting For!"

  Another reference to the 'I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag' by Country
  Joe and the Fish (see the annotation for p. 50). Maladict, in her coffee
  withdrawal hallucinations, is apparently starting to channel **Apocalypse
  Now** type Vietnam scenes.

+ [p. 177] "'Our cartoonist Fizz drew this for the special edition.'"

  The cartoonist Hablot Knight Browne used the pseudonym 'Phiz', and drew
  copperplate illustrations for many Victorian works, especially those of
  Charles Dickens.

+ [p. 177] "there was a beet stuck on the end of it"

  See the annotation for p. 68.

+ [p. 178] "Morporkia"

  Compare Victorian-era illustrations of Britannia and Columbia, depictions
  of state-gods for the United Kingdom and United States, respectively.

+ [p. 176] "'*Civis Morporkias sum*, sir.'"

  It is said that, at the time of the Roman Empire, a person could walk
  anywhere in the Empire protected only by the words "Civis Romanus sum" or
  "I am a Roman citizen", knowing that the Empire would bring down a
  terrible wrath on anyone who dared harm just one of its people.

+ [p. 180] "'Have you considered a squeezing algorithm?'"

  Blouse is describing an existing data compression technique known as
  Run-length Encoding (RLE). RLE is a simple algorithm that is well-suited
  to compressing graphic images containing limited amounts of (colour)
  information (such as the military maps containing mostly white space
  Blouse mentions).

+ [p. 191] "'Charlie's tracking us!'"

  Another Vietnam reference from Maladict's parallel universe: during the
  Vietnam War, the Viet Cong were referred to by the abbreviation "VC", or
  in radio phonetic alphabet "Victor Charlie". This was shortened to
  'Charlie' and the name became a common slang term for the enemy during
  the war.

+ [p. 192] "She'd roasted some acorns."

  During the American Civil War, the Confederacy was blockaded by the Union
  and coffee became almost unobtainable. Soldiers and citizens of the
  Confederacy experimented with, among other things, roasted acorns and
  roasted chicory as substitutes for the beverage.

+ [p. 222] "Except my Auntie Parthenope, as I recall."

  From 'parthenos', Greek for 'virgin'; Auntie Parthenope is a genuine
  maiden aunt.

+ [p. 222] "*'Tis Pity She's A Tree*"

  From John Ford's 1633 **'Tis Pity She's a Whore**, a play with an
  important, sexually-based female role played by a man.

+ [p. 223] "[...] a stick thicker than the regulation one inch"

  Popular knowledge has it that the expression "rule of thumb" comes from
  English common law regarding the diameter of a stick with which one's
  wife could legally be beaten, but this is now generally accepted to be a
  complete myth.

+ [p. 235] "[...] the job is making some other poor devil die for his."

  "Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for
  his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his
  country." – attributed to Gen. George S. Patton.

+ [p. 240] "'The SoLid DoVes,' Polly read."

  "Soiled Doves" is a euphemism for prostitutes originating in the American
  west during the 19th century.

+ [p. 284] "'In Klatch, I think, it means "I hope your donkey explodes".'"

  In Arabia, the thumbs-up gesture does mean something like "up yours". On
  occupying Iraq, many American and British soldiers were greeted with
  crowds flashing thumbs-up symbols, and mistakenly believed them to be
  showing approval.

+ [p. 303] "*Let's see how that one plays in Pluen!*"

  The Americanism "Let's see how that one plays in Peoria": "How will it
  fare when presented to the sensibilities of the rural population?"

+ [p. 309] "'[...] the Ins-and-Outs, the Side-to-Sides and the
  Backwards-and-Forwards, [...]'"

  Before the 1881 reforms, there was a British Army regiment, the 69th
  Foot, who were known as the "Ups-and-Downs" (because it mostly consisted
  of old veterans and raw recruits).

  Terry says:

  "Yep. And they – or in fact, one of them – is the subject of a folksong
  of a fairly generic kind in which (as an English folk singer once
  observed) a young lady is en route to Maidenhead when she loses her
  Aylesbury."

  There is for instance the song called 'The Ups and Downs', recorded by
  Steeleye Span:

    |   As I was going to Aylesbury all on a market day
    |   A pretty little Aylesbury girl I met upon the way
    |   Her business was to market with butter, cheese and whey
    |   And we both jogged on together my boys fol-der-o diddle-o-day
    |   And we both jogged on together my boys fol-der-o diddle-o-day

    |   As we jogged on together my boys together side by side
    |   By chance this fair maid's garter it came untied
    |   For fear that she might lose it I unto her did say
    |   Your garter's come untied my love fol-der-o diddle-o-day
    |   Your garter's come untied my love fol-der-o diddle-o-day

    |   As we rode on together my boys to the outskirts of the town
    |   At length this fair young damsel she stopped and looked around
    |   O since you've been so venturesome pray tie it up for me
    |   O I will if you go to the apple grove fol-der-o diddle-o-day
    |   O I will if you go to the apple grove fol-der-o diddle-o-day

    |   And when we got to the apple grove the grass was growing high
    |   I laid this girl upon her back her garter for to tie
    |   While tying of her garter such sights I never did see
    |   And we both jogged on together my boys fol-der-o diddle-o-day
    |   And we both jogged on together my boys fol-der-o diddle-o-day

  Etcetera. Note that this is very likely also the same cheese-and-garters
  song that Polly and the others have been discussing earlier.

+ [p. 312] "'[...] that detachment of Kopelies.'"

  'Kopelies' is Greek for 'girls'.

+ [p. 314] "'Much ado, in fact, about nothing.'"

  A Shakespeare play in which women dress as men, and which includes a
  character named Benedick. See the annotation for p. 28.

+ [p. 326] "'[...] like an ambassador but without the little gold
  chocolates.'"

  Refers to a well-known television advert for Ferrero Rocher chocolates
  (which come individually wrapped in gold foil), which were served at the
  Ambassador's balls.

+ [p. 328] "'But why did you say you were a cherry pancake?' said Polly."

  John F. Kennedy, speaking in West Berlin in 1963, famously declared: "Ich
  bin ein Berliner" – "I am a citizen of Berlin".

  As a 'Berliner' is also a kind of jam-filled pastry, Kennedy's words have
  been interpreted by some people as a language blunder, similar to the one
  Vimes makes here. This is, however, simply nonsense: the meaning Kennedy
  intended is a correct one as well, and was absolutely clear from context.

+ [p. 341] "I was part of the Thin Red Line [...]"

  The generally-accepted first use of "Thin Red Line" was when William
  Russell described in the London Times the 93rd Highlanders at the Battle
  of Balaclava in October 1854. This was then probably picked up by Rudyard
  Kipling for use in his poem 'Tommy':

    |   Yes, makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep
    |   Is cheaper than them uniforms, an' they're starvation cheap;
    |   An' hustlin' drunken soldiers when they're goin' large a bit
    |   Is five times better business than paradin' in full kit.

    |   Then it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' "Tommy, 'ow's yer soul?"
    |   But it's "Thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll,
    |   The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll,
    |   O it's "Thin red line of 'eroes" when the drums begin to roll.

  The phrase was also used as the title of James Jones' novel (and the 1998
  movie based on it) telling the story of the United States capture of
  Guadalcanal during the Second World War.

+ [p. 348] "Generals and majors and captains, oh my."

  Echoes Dorothy's "Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my!" in **The Wizard of
  Oz**.
