Witches Abroad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 7/7] "'Hurrah, I've discovered Boyle's Third Law.'"

  Sinking to the ultimate depths of trivial annotating, I suppose I should
  point out here, if only for completeness' sake, that (a) there is only
  one single 'Boyle's law', which (b) says that if temperature is kept
  constant, the volume and pressure of a gas are inversely related.

- [p. 7/7] "Like finding that bloody butterfly whose flapping wings cause
  all these storms we've been having lately [...]"

  Rather literal interpretation of one of the most often-cited examples of
  Chaos theory, called the Butterfly effect: a butterfly flapping its wings
  can cause a storm because in Chaos theory results are not proportional to
  causes.

- [p. 9/9] The three urban legends Terry mentions briefly in the footnote
  are all quite well-known, and can be found in any decent collection of
  such stories, but just in case not everyone is familiar with them:

  The first story is about a family whose grandmother dies on vacation. In
  order to avoid bureaucratic hassle they decide to strap her to the
  roof-rack of the car, and cross the border back to their own country.
  During a rest-room stop, somebody steals the car, grandmother and all.

  The second story is that of the people who return home after a night out,
  and find their dog choking to death in front of the door. They race him
  to the vet, who discovers that the dog is choking on a human finger he
  must have bitten off a burglar.

  The third story is that of a man and woman having sex in the back seat of
  a car, when some serious accident happens and they become trapped. In
  order to free them from their predicament, the car has to be cut open
  with a torch, after which the woman supposedly comments: "My husband will
  be furious, it was *his* car".

  Much more information about these and countless other urban legends can
  be found in Jan Harold Brunvand's books. If you're on the net, you may
  want to check out alt.folklore.urban.

- [p. 10/9] "She had called upon Mister Safe Way, Lady Bon Anna, Hotaloga
  Andrews and Stride Wide Man."

  Safeway is the name of a supermarket chain. Terry says: "I needed some
  good names that sounded genuinely voodoo. Now, one of the names of one of
  the classic gods is Carrefour. It's also the name of a supermarket chain
  in my part of the world, and I used to grin every time I drove past.
  Hence, by DW logic, Safeway. Bon Anna I'm pretty sure is a genuine voodoo
  goddess. The other two are entirely made up but out of, er, the right
  sort of verbal components."

- [p. 12/11] "Desiderata Hollow was making her will."

  'Desiderata' literally means: "things missing and felt to be needed". It
  is the name of a popular prose poem, written by Max Ehrman in 1927, full
  of advice about life and how to deal with it.

- [p. 16/15] "'Wish *I* was going to Genua,' she said."

  Terry writes: "This may or may not already be an annotation somewhere,
  but Genua is a 'sort of' New Orleans with a 'sort of' Magic Kingdom
  grafted on top of it.

  It had its genesis some years ago when I drove from Orlando to New
  Orleans and formed some opinions about both places: in one, you go there
  and Fun is manufactured and presented to you, in the other you just eat
  and drink a lot and fun happens."

- [p. 17/15] "'Mr Chert the troll down at the sawmill does a very good deal
  on coffins [...]'"

  This confirms the unwritten rule that says all Discworld trolls must have
  mineral names: 'chert' is a dark-coloured, flintlike quartz.

- [p. 17/16] "Her name was Lady Lilith de Tempscire, [...]"

  Tempscire is actually a French transliteration of Weatherwax.

- [p. 19/17] "[...] at least two of those present tonight were wearing
  Granny Weatherwax's famous goose-grease-and-sage chest liniment."

  In Victorian times, children's chests were often smeared with a large
  helping of goose grease in order to keep out the cold.

  Channel swimmers also used to use goose grease. Perhaps they still do...

- [p. 20/18] "'Tempers Fuggit. Means that was then and this is now,' said
  Nanny."

  Well – almost. The actual Latin phrase is "tempus fugit": "time flies".

- [p. 27/24] "As Nanny Ogg would put it, when it's teatime in Genua it's
  Tuesday over here..."

  This refers to an old and very silly song by J. Kendis and Lew Brown,
  which goes:

    |   When it's night-time in Italy, it's Wednesday over here.
    |   Oh! the onions in Sicily make people cry in California.
    |   Why does a fly? When does a bee?
    |   How does a wasp sit down to have his tea?
    |   If you talk to an Eskimo, his breath will freeze your ear.
    |   When it's night-time in Italy, it's Wednesday over here.

- [p. 30/26] "'You can't get the wood,' she said."

  This was Henry Crun's standard excuse for not actually building anything
  he'd invented, on the **Goon Show**.

- [p. 33/29] "The author, Grand Master Lobsang Dibbler, had an address in
  Ankh-Morpork."

  This is yet another incarnation of Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, the Ankhian
  entrepreneur we learn much more about in "`Moving Pictures`_", and who also
  appears in "`Small Gods`_" as the Omnian businessman Dhblah.

  Also, the name is a direct reference to Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, who was
  one of our world's more successful psychic hoaxers: actually named Cyril
  Hoskin, and son of a Devon plumber, Lobsang Rampa claimed to be a Tibetan
  monk with paranormal powers. He wrote the best-selling 1956 book **The
  Third Eye** which, even though Rampa was exposed as a fraud by **Time**
  Magazine in 1958, is still being printed and sold as the real thing 30
  years later. Rich, gullible people like actress Shirley MacLaine still
  pay money to have their 'third eye' opened up by contemporary Rampa
  equivalents.

  When questioned about the name, Terry answered: "I know all kindsa
  Tibetan names... Kelsang, Jambel, Tsong, Tenzin, Tupten (drops Tibetan
  reference book on foot)... but Lobsang is, thanks to Mr Rampa, probably
  the best known."

- [p. 33/29] "There was a knock on the door. Magrat went and opened it.
  'Hai?', she said."

  Apart from being Magrat's ninja war cry, 'Hai?' also means 'Yes?' in
  Japanese.

- [p. 38/34] "'Shut up. Anyway, she's non compost mental,' said Granny."

  "Non compos mentis" is a Latin phrase meaning "not of sound mind".

+ [p. 42/37] "'Anno Domini, I said.'"

  Anno Domini means 'year of our Lord' (as in e.g.: 1993 AD). It is indeed
  also used to denote old age, although this usage is a fairly recent
  literary invention, dating back to at least 1888 when Rudyard Kipling
  wrote the short story **Venus Annodomini**.

- [p. 47/41] "No one ran up them wearing dirndls and singing. They were not
  nice mountains."

  Refers to the opening scene of **The Sound of Music**, where Julie Andrews
  does just that: running up the mountains, and singing, and wearing
  dirndls (if you want to know what a dirndl looks like, go see the movie).

- [p. 48/42] "The witches flew along a maze of twisty little canyons, all
  alike."

  This refers back to a legendary message that appeared in Crowther &
  Woods' text adventure game **ADVENT** (see also the annotation for p.
  130/114 of "`The Colour of Magic`_"): "You are in a maze of twisty little
  passages, all alike."

  Many games have included variants of this. It also appeared in **Zork**
  ("The second of the great early experiments in computer fantasy gaming",
  as **The New Hacker's Dictionary** describes it), and in the **Hitch Hiker's
  Guide to the Galaxy** game you appear in your own brain, in "a maze of
  twisty synapses".

+ [p. 48/42] The section dealing with dwarfs (and in fact, almost
  *everything* Terry writes about dwarfs) is a parody of Tolkien's dwarves.

  In particular, compare the witches' musings on mine entries and invisible
  runes to Tolkien's scenes outside Moria. Dwarf bread brings to mind
  Tolkien's waybreads: cram and lembas. And as the witches leave the
  dwarfs, they have an encounter with a wretched creature mumbling
  something about his birthday...

- [p. 49/43] "[...] and spake thusly: 'Open up, you little sods!'"

  In Tolkien's **The Lord of the Rings** there is a famous scene outside the
  dwarven mines of Moria, where invisible runes written on the door (and
  revealed by the wizard Gandalf) give our heroes the clue as to how to get
  the door to open, namely by saying the word 'friend'.

  Personally, I like Nanny Ogg's way better.

- [p. 51/45] "[...] if more trolls stopped wearing suits and walking
  upright, and went back to living under bridges [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 193/140 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 52/45] "It's often said that eskimos have fifty words for snow. This
  is not true."

  In fact, the situation regarding eskimos and snow is pretty much the same
  as the one Terry subsequently describes for dwarfs and rocks: eskimos
  have a number of different words for different *kinds* of snow and ice,
  but nothing out of the ordinary.

- [p. 58/51] "'[...] whenever I deals with dwarfs, the phrase 'Duck's Arse'
  swims across my mind.'"

  From the phrase "tight as a duck's arse", implying excessive meanness.

- [p. 61/53] "'I knows all about folk songs. Hah! You think you're
  listenin' to a nice song about... about cuckoos and fiddlers and
  nightingales and whatnot, and then it turns out to be about... about
  something else entirely,' she added darkly."

  Just as an example of the type of song Granny may have in mind, here are
  a few verses of 'The Cuckoo's Nest':

    |   As I went a-walking one morning in May
    |   I spied a pretty fair maid and unto her did say
    |   For love I am inclined and I'll tell you of my mind
    |   That my inclination lies in your cuckoo's nest.

    |   Some like a girl who is pretty in the face
    |   And some like a girl who is slender in the waist
    |   Ah, but give me a girl who will wriggle and will twist
    |   At the bottom of the belly lies the cuckoo's nest.

  When this annotation led to a torrent of similar folk songs being
  discussed on a.f.p., at one point Terry chimed in with: "My favourite was
  something I think by a guy called Diz Disley back in the very early 70s.
  From memory:

    |   As I walked out one May morning,
    |   In the month of Februaryyy,
    |   I saw a pretty serving maid a-comin'
    |   out the dairy;

    |   A handsome knight came ridin' by
    |   I politely raised my cap and
    |   They went behind the stable
    |   and I never saw what happened."

- [p. 62/54] "'Thank goodness witches float.'"

  An obvious joke, but easily missed: refers to ducking suspected witches.
  If they drowned, they were innocent.

- [p. 62/55] "The maiden, the mother and the... other one."

  The "other one" is the crone. See also the annotation for p. 248/218.

- [p. 67/59] "'Der flabberghast,' muttered Nanny. 'What's that?' said
  Magrat. 'It's foreign for bat.'"

  Well no, it isn't, actually. The German word for bat is 'Fledermaus', as
  in Johann Strauss' famous operette **Die Fledermaus**. 'Flabberghast' seems
  to derive more from the plain English 'flabbergasted' (meaning:
  astonished beyond belief). Similarly, 'die flabbergast' apparently was a
  Mozart-spoofing sketch that Dudley Moore did in **Beyond The Fringe**.

- [p. 87/75] The names the witches are considering for themselves are puns
  on existing airline companies or their acronyms. Nanny Ogg starts to say
  **Virgin Airlines**, but is rudely interrupted by a gust of wind.

- [p. 88/77] "'I like stuff that tells you plain what it is, like...
  well... Bubble and Squeak, or... or... 'Spotted Dick,' said Nanny
  absently."

  Americans might be amazed to learn that Bubble and Squeak, Spotted Dick,
  and Toad-in-the-Hole (which is mentioned a few lines further down) are
  all actually the names of existing British delicacies.

  Nanny Ogg is correct in identifying Toad-in-the-Hole as a sausage
  embedded in a sort of tart filled with pancake batter.

  Bubble and Squeak is traditionally made on Boxing Day from Christmas
  leftovers (potato, onion, cabbage and Brussels sprouts appear to be
  favourite ingredients among alt.fan.pratchett readers, fried up together
  in lard.

  Spotted Dick is a suet-sponge pudding with currants or sultanas in it.

- [p. 89/78] "'Magrat says she will write a book called Travelling on One
  Dollar a Day, and it's always the same dollar.'"

  Refers to the famous traveller's guide originally titled **Europe on Five
  Dollars a Day**. This is of course also extensively parodied in the **Hitch
  Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy** ("see the wonders of the universe for only
  twenty Altairian dollars per day").

- [p. 91/79] "What does cojones mean?"

  'Cojones' is Spanish for 'hen's eggs', colloquially used for 'testicles'.
  The whole 'Thing with the Bulls' section spoofs the annual bull running
  festival of Pamplona in our world. Ernest Hemingway was very impressed
  with this macho activity, and used the word 'cojones' to describe the
  bravery displayed by the young men participating in the event.

  I doubt if it originated with Hemingway, but to this day "having the
  balls" is used in both English and Spanish to mean "act bravely".

- [p. 95/83] "''S called the Vieux River.' 'Yes?' 'Know what that means?'
  'No.' 'The Old (Masculine) River,' said Nanny. 'Yes?' 'Words have sex in
  foreign parts,' said Nanny hopefully."

  The Mississippi River is often known as 'Old Man River', for instance in
  the classic song from the 1936 Kern/Hammerstein musical **Show Boat**. Near
  the mouth of the Mississippi lies New Orleans, on which Genua seems to be
  largely based. And then there are the riverboats, with the gamblers...

- [p. 96/84] "[...] she wants to make it a Magic Kingdom, a Happy and
  Peaseful place [...]"

  The most famous part of the Walt Disney World theme park in Orlando,
  Florida, is officially called the 'Magic Kingdom'.

- [p. 97/84] "[...] Samedi Nuit Mort, the last night of carnivale, [...]"

  Samedi Nuit Mort = Saturday Night Dead, a reference to the television
  comedy show **Saturday Night Live**.

- [p. 97/85] "'That means Fat Lunchtime,' said Nanny Ogg, international
  linguist."

  Actually, 'Mardi Gras' means Fat Tuesday. Nanny Ogg is confusing 'Mardi'
  with 'Midi', which mean 'midday', i.e. lunchtime.

- [p. 114/99] "Even Magrat knew about Black Aliss."

  In Terry Pratchett's universe Black Aliss is obviously the evil witch of
  *all* fairy tales. The stories referred to here are **Sleeping Beauty**,
  **Rumpelstiltskin** and **Hansel And Gretel**, all of which are available as
  on-line versions (see the annotation for p. 34/34 of "`The Light
  Fantastic`_").

- [p. 122/107] "Are you the taxgatherers, dear?' 'No, ma'am, we're –' '--
  fairies,' said Fairy Hedgehog quickly."

  This is a **Blues Brothers** reference: in the film, the dialogue goes:
  "'Are you the police?' 'No, ma'am, we're musicians.'"

- [p. 134/117] "'[...] there's been other odd things happening in this
  forest.'"

  Magrat then goes on to describe more or less what happened in the fairy
  tales of **Goldilocks and the Three Bears** and **The Three Little Pigs**.

- [p. 134/118] "'[...] some ole enchantress in history who lived on an
  island and turned shipwrecked sailors into pigs.'"

  For once, Nanny Ogg *doesn't* mix up two or more real-world tales, but
  gets the story (almost) right: Circe was the name of the sorceress from
  the **Odyssey** who lived on the island Aeaea, and turned Ulysses'
  shipmates into pigs when they landed (but didn't shipwreck) there.

- [p. 136/119] "[...] around Defcon II in the lexicon of squabble."

  In the jargon of American military planners, the DEFCON scale (for
  **Defence Readiness Condition**) is used to describe the level of
  preparedness of U.S. military forces. I quote from **The Language of
  Nuclear War – An Intelligent Citizen's Dictionary** by H. Eric Semler,
  James J. Benjamin, Jr., and Adam P. Gross:

  "DEFCON 5 describes a state in which forces are at normal readiness,
  while DEFCON 1, referred to as the "cocked pistol," indicates a state of
  extreme emergency, when forces are poised for attack. Not all U.S.
  military forces are simultaneously at the same DEFCON. The DEFCON varies
  depending upon the type of weapon with which the troops are equipped and
  the region in which they are deployed. For example, U.S. troops in South
  Korea are always at DEFCON 4 but soldiers tending nuclear missiles
  deployed in the continental U.S. are normally kept at DEFCON 5. During
  the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy raised the DEFCON of
  U.S. forces to DEFCON 2 (a status just below wartime conditions)."

- [p. 137/120] "'Oh? It's all wishing on stars and fairy dust, is it?'"

  Fairly standard magic-related concepts, but perhaps it should be noted
  that wishing on stars is done in Disney's **Pinocchio**, while fairy dust
  features heavily in **Peter Pan** (both the original play and the
  subsequent Disney movie).

- [p. 137/120] "'[...] and no one doesn't get burned who sticks their hand
  in a fire.'"

  I feel that in "`Witches Abroad`_" Terry was experimenting much more than
  usual with the literary device of foreshadowing. This is only one of the
  many instances in the book where something is said that means nothing to
  the reader first time around, but which suddenly becomes very significant
  when you notice it during a re-read, and you already know what is going
  to happen later.

- [p. 139/122] "'What some people need,' said Magrat, [...], 'is a bit more
  heart.' 'What some people need,' said Granny Weatherwax, [...], 'is a lot
  more brain.' [...] What *I* need, thought Nanny Ogg fervently, is a
  drink."

  These are references to the Tin Man, Scarecrow and Lion respectively,
  once you remember that an alcoholic drink is also known as 'Dutch
  courage'. In fact, in the original book the courage the Lion is given
  comes in a bottle, and many feel that Baum had alcohol in mind when he
  wrote it.

- [p. 139/122] The farmhouse landing on Nanny Ogg, and the subsequent
  events involving dwarfs looking for ruby-coloured footwear are references
  to **The Wizard of Oz**.

  All Terry's references are to the movie version, incidentally, not the
  book. In the book Dorothy obtains Silver Shoes instead of Ruby Slippers,
  doesn't say anything approaching "... we're not in Kansas any more", and
  of course the book doesn't have a 'dingdong' song.

- [p. 140/123] "'You know, Greebo,' she said. "I don't think we're in
  Lancre.'

  Dorothy, to her dog, in **The Wizard of Oz**: "Toto, I've a feeling we're
  not in Kansas anymore."

- [p. 148/130] "'[...] that girl with the long pigtails in a tower [...]
  Rumplestiltzel or someone.'"

  The girl with the long hair is Rapunzel from the famous fairy tale of the
  same name. 'Rumpelstiltskin' is a different, unrelated fairy tale
  involving a dwarf spinning gold out of straw.

- [p. 153/134] "Not a Ronald in sight."

  Terry says: "Yep... direct use of existing East London rhyming slang
  there (Richard the Third = turd)."

- [p. 159/139] "'That's 'cos you're a wet hen, Magrat Garlick,' said
  Granny."

  When questioned about the phrase, Terry explained: "Perfectly good
  British slang. A 'wet hen' is bedraggled, sad and useless. Probably not
  as useless as a big girl's blouse, though, and better off than a lame
  duck."

- [p. 173/152] "'My full name's Erzulie Gogol,' said Mrs Gogol. 'People
  call me Mrs Gogol.'"

  This resonates with **In the Heat of the Night** (see the annotation for p.
  365/277 of "`Men at Arms`_"), in so much as we have two persons of the same
  profession, one of them black, the other white, and one of them *way* out
  of her territory.

  The name 'Erzuli' comes directly from Voodoo religion. Maitresse Erzulie
  (also known as Ezili) is the ideal figure of womanhood, and the spirit of
  love and beauty.

- [p. 174/153] "'This is Legba, a dark and dangerous spirit,' said Mrs
  Gogol."

  Legba (also known as Papa Legba or Legba Ati-bon) is the Voodoo spirit of
  the cross-roads, where the Above meets the Below. He is "on both sides of
  the mirror". He leans on a stick, and another of his symbols is the
  macoutte (straw sack). Chickens are sacrificed to him by twisting their
  neck till they are dead.

- [p. 176/154] "So he said 'Get me an alligator sandwich – and make it
  quick!'"

  It is obvious that Granny is trying to tell a joke here – and failing
  miserably. The problem was that quite a few readers (including yours
  truly) were having trouble figuring out what that joke was supposed to be
  in the first place.

  People started asking about the Alligator Joke so frequently on
  alt.fan.pratchett, that eventually Terry himself posted the following
  "definitive explanation of the alligator joke":

  "It is (I hope) obvious that Granny Weatherwax has absolutely no sense of
  humour but she has, as it were, heard about it. She has no grasp of how
  or why jokes work – she's one of those people who say "And then what
  happened?" after you've told them the punchline. She can vaguely remember
  the one-liner "Give me an alligator sandwich – and make it snappy!" but
  since she's got no idea of why it's even mildly amusing she gets
  confused... all that she can remember is that apparently the man wants it
  quickly."

  When conversation on the net then turned to the origins of the joke, he
  followed up with:

  "As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure I first came across the joke in an
  ancient US comedy routine – Durante or someone like him. It sounds
  burlesque."

  See the annotation for p. 195/159 of "Mort_" for another type of meta-joke
  based on the alligator joke.

- [p. 177/155] Emberella –> Embers; Cinderella –> Cinders...

- [p. 179/157] "'I am called Saturday.' 'Man Saturday, eh?' said Nanny Ogg."

  Nanny is thinking of Man Friday as in Robinson Crusoe's native friend.
  But Saturday is of course none other than Baron Samedi (Samedi =
  Saturday), the Voodoo keeper of cemeteries and lord of zombies. He
  appears as a skeleton wearing a top hat and a black cane.

- [p. 197/172] "Nanny Ogg waved the jug again. 'Up your eye!' she said.
  'Mud in your bottom!'"

  The two traditional English toasts being mixed up here are "bottoms up"
  and "here's mud in your eye".

- [p. 198/174] "[...] Nanny Ogg and the coachmen were getting along, as she
  put it, like a maison en flambe."

  See the annotation for p. 313/284 of "`Guards! Guards!`_"

- [p. 199/175] "[...] Nanny Ogg kept calling them 'Magrats', but they were
  trousers, and very practical."

  Calling them Magrats is a reference to Bloomers, originally a female
  costume consisting of jacket, shirt and Turkish trousers gathered closely
  around the ankles, introduced by Mrs Amelia Bloomer of New York in 1849.
  Associated with the Woman's Rights Movement, the outfit met with little
  success. Nowadays 'bloomers' is applied to the trouser portion only.

- [p. 228/201] "'This is [...] Sir, Roger de Coverley.'"

  'Sir Roger de Coverley' is the title of a folk dance.

- [p. 228/201] "'...my name is Colonel Moutarde...'"

  'Moutarde' is French for 'mustard'. Colonel Mustard is the name of one of
  the characters in the board game (and subsequent movie) **Clue** (or
  **Cluedo**).

- [p. 229/201] Casanunda, "the world's greatest lover", refers to our
  world's Casanova. Notice that Casanova is often roughly pronounced as
  'Casanover' (emphasis on the 'over'), and that Casanunda (emphasis on the
  'unda') is a dwarf...

  Actually, Casanunda is lying, because we later find out he's only the
  world's *second* greatest lover. But this should not surprise us, since
  yet even later (in "`Lords and Ladies`_") we also find out that he is an
  Outrageous Liar.

- [p. 235/207] "Nanny Ogg's voyages on the sea of intersexual dalliance had
  gone rather further than twice around the lighthouse, [...]"

  A popular way of staving off boredom at typical British seaside holiday
  resorts is to take a trip in a small boat, which will often journey out
  as far as the local lighthouse and circumnavigate it. Hence the above
  colloquialism, implying that Nanny's experiences were not limited to the
  inshore waters of male/female relationships.

- [p. 248/218] "The maiden, the mother and the crone."

  Traditionally, the wiccan goddess (see "`Equal Rites`_" annotation) is
  viewed as the triple entity maiden/mother/crone, and our witches indeed
  echo this model. Neil Gaiman uses the triple goddess quite often in his
  **Sandman** series.

- [p. 249/219] "Mrs Gogol's hut travelled on four large duck feet, which
  were now rising out of the swamp."

  Baba Yaga is a witch in Russian folklore, who had a hut that stood, and
  was able to turn around, on chicken feet. I don't believe that hut could
  walk, however. (Neil Gaiman seemed to think it could, though: Baba Yaga
  and a walking hut figure in Book 3 of his excellent **Books of Magic**.)

  One of Mussorgsky's **Pictures at an Exhibition** ('House on hen's legs')
  also refers back to Baba Yaga, by way of another Russian's painting of
  said fairy tale hut.

- [p. 252/222] "'I'm a world-famous liar.' 'Is that true?' 'No.'"

  Casanunda here recreates the famous liar paradox: Epimenides the Cretan
  saying "All Cretans are liars". For more information on this paradox see
  any good book about logic puzzles, although I particularly recommend
  Douglas R. Hofstadter's **Metamagical Themas**.

- [p. 252/222] "'Well, maybe I'm only No. 2,' said Casanunda. 'But I try
  harder.'"

  This was the catchphrase from a well-known ad campaign in the late 60s.
  The No. 2 was car rental firm Avis; Hertz was No. 1.

  Avis still uses the "we try harder" slogan, but the "we're No. 2" part
  was dropped a long time ago.

- [p. 274/241] "'[...] what was that Tsortean bloke who could only be
  wounded if you hit 'im in the right place?'"

  Nanny is thinking of the Discworld version of Achilles, who was
  invincible except for a small spot on his heel.

- [p. 285/252] "Nanny kicked her red boots together idly. 'Well, I suppose
  there's no place like home,' she said."

  Another **Wizard of Oz** reference (kicking her shoes together three times
  and saying a similar sentence invoked the spell that transported Dorothy
  home from Oz).

+ [p. 285/252] "But they went the long way, and saw the elephant."

  Several people were immediately reminded of Fritz Leiber's Hugo award
  winning novelette **Gonna Roll The Bones**, which ends: "Then he turned and
  headed straight for home, but he took the long way, around the world."
  Terry has said there is no conscious connection, however.

  "Seeing the elephant" also resonates nicely with **The Lord of the Rings**,
  where Bilbo complains wistfully that he never got to see an elephant on
  *his* adventures 'abroad': "[...] Aragorn's affairs, and the White
  Council, and Gondor, and the Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts –
  did you really see one, Sam? – and caves and towers and golden trees and
  goodness knows what besides. I evidently came back by much too straight a
  road from my trip. I think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit."

  Also, "to have seen the elephant" is British military slang dating back
  to the 19th century, and means to have taken part in one's first battle,
  while during the 1849 California Goldrush, "going to see the elephant"
  was widely used as a phrase by people to signify their intention to
  travel westwards and try their luck. (See e.g. JoAnn Levy's 1999 book
  **They Saw the Elephant: Women in the California Gold Rush**.)
