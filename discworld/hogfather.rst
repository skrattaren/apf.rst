Hogfather
~~~~~~~~~

+ [dedication] "To the guerilla bookshop manager known to friends as
  'ppint' [...]"

  The bookshop in question is **Interstellar Master Traders** in Lancaster.
  ppint is a longtime contributor to alt.fan.pratchett, well-known for,
  amongst many other things, maintaining a number of that group's
  "Frequently Asked Questions" documents.

+ [dedication] "[...] the question Susan asks in this book."

  Many people have found it difficult to determine just what this question
  is. Perhaps this is because the Oh God of Hangovers asks it first, on p.
  153, after which Susan turns to the Death of Raths and relays the
  question to him: "'Actually... where *do* [the Tooth Fairies] take the
  teeth?'"

+ When "Hogfather_" was being written, Terry answered the question what it
  was going to be about as follows:

  "Let's see, now...in "Hogfather_" there are a number of stabbings,
  someone's killed by a man made of knives, someone's killed by the dark,
  and someone just been killed by a wardrobe.

  It's a book about the magic of childhood. You can tell."

+ [p. 7] "Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree."

  Most physicists believe the universe started with a 'big bang.' The
  contrary view is that the universe is essentially a 'steady state'
  system, though this is difficult to reconcile with the available
  evidence. See also the annotation for p. 8/8 of "`The Colour of Magic`_".

+ [p. 8] "[...] the Verruca Gnome is running around [...]"

  A verruca is a large wart that appears on the sole of the foot, also
  called a plantar wart. Apparently the word is not commonly used in
  America.

+ [p. 13] "'[...] a stiff brandy before bedtime quite does away with the
  need for the Sandman.'"

  The Sandman supposedly sends children to sleep by throwing sand in their
  eyes, although we have found out (in "`Soul Music`_") that, on the
  Discworld, he doesn't bother to take the sand out of the sack first.

+ [p. 13] "'And, since I can carry a tune quite well, I suspect I'm not
  likely to attract the attention of Old Man Trouble.'"

  A character from the Gershwin song 'I've Got Rhythm'. See also the
  annotation for p. 86 of "`Feet of Clay`_".

+ [p. 16] "'Let us call him the Fat Man.'"

  This nickname has an honourable history, dating back at least as far as
  the 1941 classic film **The Maltese Falcon**. It was also the codename of
  the second (and, so far, the last) atomic bomb ever used in war, which
  was dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945.

+ [p. 24] "She'd got Gawain on the military campaigns of General Tacticus,
  [...]"

  We learn a lot more about this character in "Jingo_". The name seems to be
  a conflation of the word 'tactics' with the Roman historian Tacitus.

+ [p. 25] "[...] if she did indeed ever find herself dancing on rooftops
  with chimney sweeps [...]"

  A famous scene from the 1964 film **Mary Poppins**. Miss Poppins used her
  umbrella as a sort of magic wand to grant wishes for the children in her
  charge. See also the annotation for p. 56.

+ [p. 26] "[...] the hope that some god or other would take their soul if
  they died while they were asleep [...]"

  Susan is thinking of an 18th-century prayer still popular in parts of
  America:

    |   Now I lay me down to sleep,
    |   I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
    |   If I should die before I wake,
    |   I pray the Lord my soul to take.

+ [p. 26] "'[...] *yes*, Twyla: there *is* a Hogfather.'"

  Susan's response to Twyla's question loosely parodies a delightfully
  sentimental editorial that first appeared in **The New York Sun** in
  December 1897. The editorial **Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus**,
  appropriately enough, uses the ideas of 'deeper truths' and 'values' to
  demonstrate that Santa *must* exist.

+ [p. 28] Medium Dave and Banjo Lilywhite.

  From the Trad. song 'Green grow the rushes, O': "Two, two the Lilywhite
  boys, clothed all in green, O".

+ [p. 34] "Deaths's destination was a slight rise in the trench floor."

  The environment Death visits is called "Black Smokes". It is a lifeform
  that is not based on photosynthesis in any way.

+ [p. 35] "The omnipotent eyesight of various supernatural entities is
  often remarked upon. It is said they can see the fall of every sparrow."

  Matthew 10:29, for instance: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
  and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father."

+ [p. 39-40] "'"Oh, there might be some temp'ry inconvenience now, my good
  man, but just come back in fifty thousand years."'"

  There is very often a clear parallel between Discworld magic and our
  world's nuclear power. This is the sort of timescale it takes for
  plutonium waste to decay to a 'harmless' state. Given Terry's background
  in the nuclear industry, and his comments since, there's no doubt that
  these parallels are intended.

+ [p. 42] "'Give me a child until he seven and he is mine for life.'"

  A Jesuit maxim. See the annotation for p. 12/10 of "`Small Gods`_".

+ [p. 44] "It was the night before Hogwatch. All through the house...
  ...one creature stirred. It was a mouse."

  In Clement Clarke Moore's poem **The Night Before Christmas**, "not a
  creature was stirring, not even a mouse".

+ [p. 47] "[...] the Quirmian philosopher Ventre, who said, 'Possibly the
  gods exist and possibly they do not. So why not believe in them in any
  case? If it's all true you'll go to a lovely place when you die, and if
  it isn't then you've lost nothing, right?'"

  This is a rephrasing of Pascal's Wager: "If you believe in God and turn
  out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing – but if you don't believe in
  God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is
  foolish to be an atheist." (Formulation quoted from the alt.atheism
  "Common Arguments" webpage,
  <http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/arguments.html#pascal>)

+ [p. 47] "'You could try "Pig-hooey!"'"

  In P. G. Wodehouse's **Blandings Castle**, this cry was recommended to
  Clarence, Earl of Emsworth, as an all-purpose call to food, and used in
  the enforced absence of his pig man to get the mighty Empress back to the
  trough. As such it is perhaps not surprising that Gouger, Rooter, Tusker
  and Snouter did not accelerate away at the sound – they were presumably
  waiting for Albert to produce the nosebags.

+ [p. 48] "'Look at robins, now. [...] all they got to do is go
  bob-bob-bobbing along [...]'"

  From the song "When the red, red robin comes bob-bob-bobbing along..."

+ [p. 49] "In Biers no one took any notice."

  The bar "Cheers", from the TV show of the same name, has often been
  parodied as "Beers". See also the annotation for p. 84 of "`Feet of
  Clay`_".

+ [p. 50] "'Now then, Shlimazel'"

  "Shlimazel" is a Yiddish word meaning someone who always has bad luck, a
  sad sack, a terminally unsuccessful person. (From German "schlimm",
  meaning "bad", and the Hebrew "mazal", meaning "luck" – or
  "constellation", as in "ill-starred".)

+ [p. 54] "'Did you check the list?' YES, TWICE. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
  ENOUGH?"

  This is the first of many references to the song 'Santa Claus is coming
  to town'. "He's making a list, he's checking it twice, he's gonna find
  out who's naughty and nice..." Other references are on p. 60 and p. 84.

+ [p. 54] "Here we are, here we are," said Albert. "James Riddle, aged
  eight."

  Jimmy Riddle is rhyming slang for "piddle".

+ [p. 56] "the window opened into the branches of a cherry tree."

  Possibly another echo of **Mary Poppins** (see the annotation for p.
  25), who lived at 10 Cherry Tree Road. The raven's constant harping on
  about robins also echoes the movie.

+ [p. 60] "'The rat says: you'd better watch out...'"

  The song "Santa Claus is coming to town" takes on a whole new meaning on
  the Discworld. See also the annotation for p. 69/52 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 66] "She'd never looked for eggs laid by the Soul Cake Duck."

  The Discworld equivalent of the Easter Bunny. See also the annotation
  for p. 193/139 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 67] "'I happen to like fern patterns,' said Jack Frost coldly."

  A Tom Swiftie, followed by another one on the next page: "'I don't
  sleep,' said Frost icily, [...]". See the annotation for p. 26/26 of "`The
  Light Fantastic`_".

+ [p. 73] "In general outline, at least. But with more of a PG rating."

  PG = Parental Guidance suggested – a film classification used in the USA
  and the UK, meaning that "some material may not be suitable for
  children".

+ [p. 74] "Between every rational moment were a billion irrational ones."

  In mathematics, between every rational number there are an infinite
  number of irrational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be
  expressed in the form of _p/q`_" where _p`_" and _q`_" are integers. Irrational
  numbers are ones that can't, such as _pi`_" or the square root of 2.

+ [p. 77] "A man might spend his life peering at the private life of
  elementary particles and then find he either knew who he was or where he
  was, but not both."

  A lovely reference to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (see the
  annotation for p. 178/171 of "Pyramids_"). Also plays on the stereotype of
  the absent-minded old scientist.

+ [p. 79] "'Archchancellor Weatherwax only used it once [...]'"

  Archchancellor Weatherwax was in charge of UU in the time of "`The Light
  Fantastic`_", estimated (by some deeply contorted calculation) to be set
  about 25 years before the time of "Hogfather_". See also the annotation
  for p. 8/8 of "`The Light Fantastic`_".

+ [p. 82] 'Old Faithful' is the name of the famous big regular geyser in
  Yellowstone Park. No wonder Ridcully feels 'clean'.

+ [p. 83] "*On the second day of Hogswatch I... sent my true love back A
  nasty little letter, hah, yes, indeed, and a partridge in a pear tree.*"

  Clearly the Discworld version of "The twelve days of Christmas" is rather
  less, umm, unilateral.

+ [p. 83] "'*– the rising of the sun, and the running of the deer –*'"

  The song is 'The Holly and the Ivy':

    |   The Holly and the Ivy, when they are both full grown,
    |   Of all the trees that are in the wood, the holly bears the crown.

    |   Oh, the rising of the sun, and the running of the deer,
    |   The playing of the merry organ, sweet singing in the choir.

    |   The Holly bears a berry, as red as any blood,
    |   And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good...

  etc.

+ [p. 84] "I KNOW IF THEY ARE PEEPING, Death added proudly."

  Another echo of 'Santa Claus is coming to town': "He sees you when you're
  peeping". See the annotations for p. 54 and p. 60.

+ [p. 86] "'I mean, tooth fairies, yes, and them little buggers that live
  in flowers, [...]'"

  Flower fairies are a Victorian invention, often illustrated in
  sickeningly cute pictures and still widely popular in America. See also
  "`Witches Abroad`_".

+ [p. 86] "Oh, how the money was coming in."

  This has been tentatively linked to a famous parody song, to the tune of
  of 'My Bonnie lies over the ocean': "My father makes counterfeit money,
  my mother brews synthetic gin, my sister makes loves to the sailors: my
  God, how the money rolls in!"

+ [p. 92] "Many people are aware of the Weak and Strong Anthropic
  Principles."

  Physicists have discovered that there are a large number of
  'coincidences' inherent in the fundamental laws and constants of nature,
  seemingly *designed* or 'tuned' to lead to the development of intelligent
  life. Every one of these coincidences or specific relationships between
  fundamental physical parameters is needed, or the evolution of life and
  consciousness as we know it could not have happened. This set of
  coincidences is known collectively as the "Anthropic Principle."

  The 'Weak Anthropic Principle' states, roughly, that "since we are here,
  the universe must have the properties that make it possible for us to
  exist, so the coincidences are not surprising".

  The 'Strong Anthropic Principle' says that "the universe *can* only exist
  at all because it has these properties – it would be impossible for it
  to develop any other way."

  In some quarters, the idea has re-ignited the old 'argument-from-design'
  for the existence of God.

+ [p. 94] "'Sufficiently *advanced* magic.'"

  A perfect inversion of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum that "any sufficiently
  advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

+ [p. 94] "'Interesting. Saves all that punching holes in bits of card and
  hitting keys you lads are forever doing, then –'"

  Holes punched in cards were used to input programs and data to computers
  up until roughly the early 1970s, when keyboards became standard.

+ [p. 95] "+++ Why Do You Think You Are A Tickler? +++"

  The conversation between the Bursar and Hex is reminiscent of the **Eliza**
  program.

  **Eliza** is a program written in the dark ages of computer science by
  Joseph Weizenbaum to simulate an indirect psychiatrist. It works by
  transforming whatever the human says into a question using a few very
  simple rules. To his grave concern, Weizenbaum discovered that people
  took his simple program for real and demanded to be left alone while
  'conversing' with it.

+ [p. 95] "[...] Hex's 'Anthill Inside' sticker [...]"

  Refers to a marketing campaign launched by semiconductor manufacturer
  Intel in the 1990s.

  Intel's problem was that, although it has almost all of the market for
  personal computer chips, its lawyers couldn't stop rival manufacturers
  from making chips that were technically identical – or, very often,
  better and cheaper. Its response was to launch the 'Intel Inside'
  sticker, to attach to a computer's case in the hope of persuading end
  customers that this made it better.

+ [p. 99] "You know there's some people up on the Ramtops who kill a wren
  at Hogswatch and walk around from house to house singing about it?"

  There is a folksong about the hunting of the wren:

    |   Oh where are you going, says Milder to Maulder
    |   Oh we may not tell you, says Festle to Fose
    |   We're off to the woods, says John the red nose
    |   We're off to the woods, says John the red nose

    |   And what will you do there...
    |   We'll hunt the cutty wren...

  In Ireland until quite recently, the hunting of the wren on St. Stephen's
  day – Dec. 26th – was a very real tradition. People did kill a wren and
  hang it on a branch of a holly tree, taking it from house to house rather
  like children trick-or-treating on Hallowe'en.

+ [p. 100] "Blind Io the Thunder God used to have these myffic ravens that
  flew anywhere and told him everything that was going on."

  The main Viking god Odin, although not a thunder god, had two ravens,
  Hugin and Munin, who did this. He also had only one eye.

+ [p. 100] "'[...] he'd go to the Castle of Bones.'"

  King Arthur visited this place of horror with a bunch (24? 49? 144?) of
  his trusted knights and re-emerged with only seven left alive. No one
  ever told what they had encountered there. I believe it was a faerie
  castle.

+ [p. 104] "The Aurora Corealis"

  See the annotation for p. 85/69 of "Mort_".

+ [p. 118] "YES INDEED, HELLO, SMALL CHILD CALLED VERRUCA LUMPY, [...]"

  Confirms Ridcully's remark on p. 86 that the word can be used as a name.

+ [p. 119] "'Willow bark', said the Bursar."

  Willow bark contains aspirin.

+ [p. 121] "'[...] that drink, you know, there's a worm in the bottle...'"

  Mescal. See also the annotation for p. 252/190 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 121] "'[...] surrounded by naked maenads.'"

  Maenads are from Greek mythology and were tied up with Dionysus, God of
  Wine. They were beautiful, nude and indeed maniacal, possessed of an
  unfortunate tendency to tear apart anyone they met, especially if it was
  male.

+ [p. 123] TINKLE. TINKLE. *FIZZ*.

  An old advertising campaign for Alka-Seltzer (a medicine often used as a
  hangover cure), used the line "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz" to describe the
  sound of the pills dropping into water and dissolving.

+ [p. 126] "'*I saw this in **Bows and Ammo**!*'"

  See the annotation for p. 328/236 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

+ [p. 132] "While evidence says that the road to Hell is paved with good
  intentions, [...]"

  This is confirmed by the eyewitness testimony of Rincewind and Eric (in
  "Eric_").

+ [p. 134] "'Sarah the little match girl, [...]'"

  The little match girl dying of hypothermia on Christmas eve is a
  traditional fairy tale, best known in the version written by Hans
  Christian Anderson.

+ [p. 135] "'You're for life, not just for Hogswatch,' prompted Albert."

  Plays on an old advertising slogan intended to discourage giving puppies
  as Christmas presents without thinking about how they'll be cared for the
  rest of their lives.

  Compare also the motto for Lady Sybil's Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick
  Dragons: "Remember, A Dragon is For Life, Not Just for Hogswatchnight".

+ [p. 139] "Hex worried Ponder Stibbons."

  The present incarnation of Hex has a lot of in-jokes about modern
  (mid-90s) personal computers.

  The computer business is littered with TLAs (three-letter abbreviations),
  such as CPU, RAM, VDU, FTP; Hex has its CWL (clothes wringer from the
  laundry), FTB (fluffy teddy bear), GBL (great big lever). "Small
  religious pictures" are icons, and they are used with a mouse. Ram skulls
  are an echo of RAM (random-access memory).

  The beehive long-term storage is a little more obscure, but in the 1980s
  some mainframes had a mass storage system that involved data stored on
  tapes wound onto cylinders. The cylinders of tape were stored in a set of
  hexagonal pigeon holes, and retrieved automatically by the computer as
  needed; systems diagrams always depicted this part of the computer as a
  honeycomb pattern. And then there's of course the fact that 'beehive'
  rhymes with 'B-drive', which is how one usually refers to the secondary
  floppy drive in a personal computer.

  Interestingly, Douglas R. Hofstader's **Goedel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal
  Golden Braid** contains a chapter in which one of the characters (the
  Anteater) describes how an anthill can be viewed as a brain, in which the
  movements of ants are the thoughts of the heap.

+ [p. 141] "+++ Error at Address:14, Treacle Mine Road, Ankh-Morpork +++"

  A common error message on many types of computer tells you that there is
  an error at a certain memory address, expressed as a number. This
  information is completely useless to anyone except a programmer.

  Based on "`The Streets of Ankh-Morpork`_", it has been suggested that this
  may be the address of CMOT Dibbler's cellar, mentioned in "`Reaper Man`_".

+ [p. 141] "'I know it sounds stupid, Archchancellor, but we think it might
  have caught something off the Bursar.'"

  Possibly Hex has caught a virus. On the Discworld, there's no obvious
  reason why a virus shouldn't be transmittable from human to computer or
  vice-versa.

  In the early 1970s there appeared a sort of proto-virus called the
  'Cookie Monster', which cropped up on a number of computers – notably
  Multics-based machines. What would happen is that unsuspecting users
  would suddenly find messages demanding cookies on their terminals, and
  they would not be able to proceed until they typed 'COOKIE' or
  'HAVECOOKIE', etc. – in much the same way as Hex is 'cured' by typing
  'DRYDFRORGPILLS'.

  For more details see: <http://www.multicians.org/cookie.html>

+ [p. 143] "'You don't have to shout, Archchancellor,' said Ponder."

  In on-line conversations, a common error among newcomers is typing
  everything in block capital letters, known colloquially as 'shouting'.
  This causes varying degrees of irritation among readers. There are also
  some people with vision impairments who use software that purposely uses
  capital letters, as they are easier to read, but fortunately this
  software is improving.

+ [p. 143] "Then it wrote: +++ Good Evening, Archchancellor. I Am Fully
  Recovered And Enthusiastic About My Tasks +++"

  Hex's polite phrasing here parodies that of the famous computer HAL from
  Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's movie _2001: A Space Odyssey`_" (and
  the sequel _2010`_"), who said things like: "Good afternoon, gentlemen. I
  am a HAL 9000 computer" and "I am completely operational and all my
  systems are functioning perfectly".

+ [p. 144] "What does 'divide by cucumber' mean?" "Oh, Hex just says that
  if it comes up with an answer that it knows can't possibly be real."

  The real-world version of this is is known as a "Divide by Zero" error.
  Dividing by zero is an operation not allowed by the rules of mathematics,
  and computers will generate an error when asked to perform it.

+ [p. 150] "[...] I can TALK THAT TALK and stalk that stalk [...]"

  The usual phrase is, of course, "talk the talk and walk the walk",
  meaning to both say and do the right thing. If anyone can definitively
  point to the origin of this phrase, I'd be interested to know it –
  possibly from the US civil rights movement of the 1960s.

  It's been mentioned more than once that the Stanley Kubrick movie **Full
  Metal Jacket**, the character Joker bandies words with a marine called
  Animal Mother, who answers: "You talk the talk but do you walk the walk?"
  This encounter may be significant purely because Animal Mother's helmet
  bears the text "I AM BECOME DEATH".

+ [p. 154] "There are those who believe that [...] there was some Golden
  Age [...] when [...] the stones fit together so you could hardly put a
  knife between them, you know, and it's obvious they had flying machines,
  right, because of the way the earthworks can only be seen from above,
  yeah?"

  This speculation has been advanced in the context of, e.g., the ancient
  pyramids of Peru, where the stones really do fit together almost
  perfectly, and where the Kuta Lines really can only be seen from above.

  Apparently the part of Peru where the Inca lived is rather prone to
  earthquakes, and not wanting their perfectly fitting stones to fall over
  and break into little pieces when the earth moved, the Inca built all
  their major buildings with the walls sloping inwards. Many Inca buildings
  are still standing (less a roof or two, of course), in sharp contrast
  with California, where modern buildings fall over with distressing
  regularity.

  Britain has things called leylines – ancient sites so arranged that they
  draw a perfectly straight line across a map, allegedly impossible to
  trace without modern cartographical techniques.

  For the most bizarre extrapolation of this belief, see Erich von Daniken,
  **Chariots of the Gods**, which claims not only that aliens visited the
  earth in ancient times, but also that they actually started human
  civilisation.

  The footnote ties together a number of modern myths about aliens, ending
  with the "The truth may be out there...", the catchphrase of the 90s TV
  series **The X-Files**.

+ [p. 155] "'Lares and Penates? What were they when they were at home?'
  said Ridcully."

  They were Roman household gods.

  There are many beautiful shrines to them – there was at least one in
  every well-to-do ancient Roman house. The god that saw to it "that the
  bread rose" was called Priapus, a god of fertility, who was
  conventionally represented by or with a huge phallus.

+ [p. 155] "'Careless talk creates lives!'"

  A propaganda poster first used in the First World War bore the slogan
  "Careless talk costs lives" as an admonition against saying anything, to
  anyone, about (for instance) where your loved ones were currently
  serving, in case a spy was listening. (Also: loose lips sink ships.)

  Interestingly, the Auditors also feel that there is no difference between
  creating and costing lives.

+ [p. 157] "'Oh, what fun,' muttered Albert."

  Once again Terry completely inverts the meaning of a song lyric without
  changing a single word (see the annotation for p. 60). The original song
  here is 'Jingle Bells': "Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open
  sleigh".

+ [p. 162] "'[...] they say you can Earn $$$ in Your Spare Time [...]'"

  Refers to the nuisance phenomenon on the Internet called 'spam'. Email
  with subject lines resembling the above are mass-mailed out to thousands
  of people in the hope that a small fraction of them will fall for it, and
  be persuaded to perpetuate what was, in essence, a pyramid scheme, and
  highly illegal in most countries. This sort of 'Make Money Fast' spam is
  growing rarer these days, being replaced with unsolicited ads for
  too-good-to-be-true credit cards, mass-email programs and cheap
  long-distance phone calls.

+ [p. 165] "[...], would even now be tiring of painting naked young ladies
  on some tropical island somewhere"

  A reference to the painter Paul Gaugin, who spent his most productive
  years in the South Pacific doing just this.

+ [p. 166] "The old man in the hovel looked uncertainly at the feast [...]"

  The episode of the king and the old man is based on the story of Good
  King Wenceslas. Of course, Terry doesn't quite see it the way of the
  Christmas carol.

+ [p. 177] "It might help to think of the universe as a rubber sheet, or
  perhaps not."

  A common device to help visualise the effect of gravity on the fabric of
  the universe, similarly useless beyond a certain point. See also the
  annotation for p. 230/207 of "Sourcery_".

+ [p. 177] "'It's brass monkeys out here.'"

  The full expression is "cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass
  monkey".

  The expression supposedly dates back to a time when cannon balls were
  stored on the decks of ships in pyramid-shaped stacks held in place by a
  brass frame around the base. This frame was called a 'monkey', and when
  it got very cold, the brass monkey would contract, causing the stacks of
  cannon balls to collapse.

+ [p. 181] "[...] OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NO HOMES. IS THIS FAIR? 'Well, of
  course, that's the big issue –' Albert began."

  In the UK and Australia, **The Big Issue** is a magazine sold by the
  homeless. In many cities all over the world similar projects have been
  started.

+ [p. 184] "A large hourglass came down on the spring."

  Ever since the Apple Macintosh, graphical user interfaces for computers
  have used a special cursor shape to indicate that a lengthy operation is
  in progress. The Windows hourglass cursor is Microsoft's version Apple's
  original wristwatch.

+ [p. 185] "'Remember when we had all that life force all over the place? A
  man couldn't call his trousers his own!'"

  For the details of the time Ridcully is referring to, read "`Reaper Man`_".

+ [p. 190] "'Excuse me madam' said Ridcully. 'But is that a chicken on your
  shoulder?' 'It's, er, it's, er, it's the Blue Bird of Happiness' said the
  Cheerful Fairy."

  In **The Blue Bird** by Maurice Maeterlinck, published in German in 1909,
  two children set off on a long journey to find the Blue Bird of
  Happiness, only to learn that it was in their own back garden all along.

  There's also a Far Side cartoon wherein "Ned, the Bluebird of Happiness
  long absent from his life, is visited by the Chicken of Depression".

+ [p. 192] "According to my theory it is cladisticaly associated with the
  Krullian pipefish, sir, which is also yellow and goes around in bunches
  or shoals."

  Normally, cladists are those who try to classify organisms in such a way
  that related species are placed in the same family, not in a family with
  other species that look the same. This is quite the opposite to Ponder's
  cladism. This method of classification is called "dichotomous key
  classification": unfortunately Ponder has left out the conventional first
  step in this kind of identification, which is something along the lines
  of "can it move unassisted?" – if so, go to animal, if not, go to
  plants.

  In our world, there is also some classificational confusion concerning
  bananas, since the so-called banana tree is technically a banana *plant*
  (its stem does not contain actual wood tissue), which would make the
  banana (so the argument goes) a herb instead of a fruit. This is one
  those arguments that never really gets resolved, because the 'answer' can
  simply go either way depending on what definitions you use in which
  contexts.

+ [p. 193] "Sometimes a chicken is nothing but a bird."

  Freud once said "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar", for much the same
  reason.

+ [p. 195] "'Hogswatch is coming, The pig is getting fat, [...]'"

  There is a song that goes:

    |   Christmas is coming, and the goose is getting fat
    |   Won't you put a penny in the old man's hat?
    |   If you haven't got a penny a ha'penny will do
    |   And if you haven't got a ha'penny then God bless you.

+ [p. 195] "'– nobody knows how good we can live, on boots three times a
  day...'"

  A standard children's song, once (apparently) popular at Girl Guide
  camps, went:

    |   Everybody hates me, nobody loves me,
    |   Think I'll go and eat worms.
    |   Long thin slimy ones, short fat stubby ones,
    |   Juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy worms.
    |   Bite their heads off, suck their juice out,
    |   Throw their skins away.
    |   Nobody knows how good we can live
    |   On worms three times a day.

+ [p. 195] "'Ah, Humbugs?' he said."

  In Charles Dickens' **A Christmas Carol**, Scrooge has the catchphrase
  "Bah! Humbug!".

+ [p. 208] "'[...] letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands of
  –'"

  Darwin gathered much of the data for his version of evolutionary theory
  while in the Galapagos Islands, which he visited on HMS **Beagle**.

+ [p. 212] "'You know what happens to kids who suck their thumbs, there's
  this big monster with scissors all –'"

  There is a classic set of children's stories called (in English)
  **Slovenly Peter**, by Heinrich Hoffman, originally written in German circa
  1840. One of the stories is about the scissor man, who comes in and cuts
  the thumbs off of a little girl who refuses to stop sucking her thumbs.

+ [p. 213] "But she was used to the idea of buildings that were bigger on
  the inside than on the outside. Her grandfather had never been able to
  get a handle on dimensions."

  In the legendary BBC TV series **Dr Who**, the Tardis is famous for being
  "bigger on the inside than on the outside". When the series began in
  1963, the Doctor was accompanied by his "granddaughter", Susan.

  However, before jumping to any conclusions, see the annotation for p.
  20/15 of "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 219] "'You could get them to open Dad's wallet and post the contents
  to some address?'"

  A US television presenter named Soupy Sales was hosting a children's TV
  show in 1965, and in one famous live episode ad-libbed:

  "Hey kids, last night was New Year's Eve, and your mother and dad were
  out having a great time. They are probably still sleeping and what I want
  you to do is tiptoe in their bedroom and go in your mom's pocketbook and
  your dad's pants, which are probably on the floor. You'll see a lot of
  green pieces of paper with pictures of guys in beards. Put them in an
  envelope and send them to me at Soupy Sales, Channel 5, New York, New
  York. And you know what I'm going to send you? A post card from Puerto
  Rico!"

  That the station subsequently got $80,000 in the mail appears to be a bit
  of an urban legend, but Soupy's show did get pulled for two weeks before
  he was allowed back on the air again.

+ [p. 229] "I know I made that mistake with little William Rubin [...]"

  Bilirubin is formed when haemoglobin is broken down, and is basically the
  the pigment that makes faeces brown.

  In **The Silence of the Lambs**, by Thomas Harris, Hannible Lecter at one
  point says that the killer 'Buffalo Bill' is a former patient of his
  named Bill Rubin. In Harris' previous book **Red Dragon** the killer
  Francis Dolorhyde had no teeth and was known as the Tooth Fairy.

  Terry explains the name as follows:

  "Oh, lor'. Billy Rubim is an old medical student joke..."

  "Like most really stupid jokes, it's one that you won't spot unless you
  have the right background. Others on here will doubtless explain, but
  according to one of my informants, a nurse, every batch of medical
  students learns it anew and Mr Rubin's name turns up in various places to
  general sniggering."

+ [p. 229] "They don't think twice about pushing off for a month as a big
  white bull or a swan or something [...]"

  The Greek gods, particularly Zeus, were fond of incarnating themselves as
  animals of this sort, usually as part of a scheme to seduce or ravish
  some unsuspecting young woman. On the Discworld, Om used to do the same
  sort of thing. See "`Small Gods`_" for details.

+ [p. 232] "'There *are* magic wardrobes,' said Violet nervously. 'If
  you go into them, you come out in a magic land.'"

  A land such as Narnia. See the annotation for p. 22/22 of "Sourcery_".

+ [p. 235] "'I thought you had to clap your hands and say you believed in
  'em,' [...] 'That's just for the little shiny ones,' [...]"

  The fairies in J M Barrie's **Peter Pan**, Tinkerbell in particular, are
  generally kept happy (and alive) in this fashion. I don't know if there's
  an earlier reference.

+ [p. 236] "The Dean took a small glass cube from his pocket and ran it
  over the corpse."

  A scene familiar to anyone who's ever watched an episode of **Star Trek**.

+ [p. 236] "+++ Big Red Lever Time +++ Query +++"

  Old IBM mainframes (as well as, later, the first IBM PCs), had large,
  bright red, power switches, causing the phrase "big red switch" (often
  abbreviated as BRS) to enter the hacker's jargon.

  Hex, after seeing Death enter the laboratory, is in fact asking if Death
  has come for him, which (a) throws an interesting light on Hex's own
  feelings about his sentience, and (b) explains why Death's reply to Hex
  starts with the word "No".

+ [p. 237] "+++ Yes. I Am Preparing An Area Of Write-Only Memory +++"

  'Write-Only Memory' is a curious, but pointless concept, since the data
  stored there can presumably never be retrieved. Real computers do have a
  type of storage called 'Read-Only Memory', or ROM, which contains
  information that can never be erased or overwritten.

  Write-Only memory has a real world precedence in a practical joke
  perpetrated by an engineer working for Signetics corporation. The joke
  was eventually given a wider audience in the April 1972 issue of
  **Electronics** magazine.

+ [p. 239] "Family motto *Non timetis messor*"

  This translates to "Don't fear the reaper", the title of a well-known
  song by Blue Oyster Cult.

+ [p. 258] "'I didn't even *have* any of that salmon mousse!'"

  In **Monty Python's The Meaning of Life**, a dinner party is rather spoiled
  when Death visits (a Death not entirely unlike the Discworld's). The
  visit is occasioned by the hostess serving tinned salmon mousse, and the
  American guest complains that he didn't have any salmon mousse.

+ [p. 265] "'What are you waiting for? Hogswatch?'"

  "What are you waiting for? Christmas?" is a mild taunt used to encourage
  someone to start doing something. It is, for instance, what Duke Nukem in
  the computer game **Duke Nukem 3D** says after the player has been inactive
  for a while. Given Terry Pratchett's love of other games in that genre
  (such as **Doom** and **Tombraider**) a familiarity with Duke Nukem may
  perhaps have contributed to his use of the phrase here.

+ [p. 267] "The man was tattooed. Blue whorls and spirals haunted his
  skin..."

  The ancient Celts painted blue patterns on their skin using the woad
  plant, possibly as a means of setting the warriors apart from civilians.

+ [p. 269] "'I remember hearing,' said Susan distantly, 'that the idea of
  the Hogfather wearing a red and white outfit was invented quite
  recently.' NO. IT WAS REMEMBERED."

  The whole concept of the modern Santa Claus is commonly ascribed to a
  Coca Cola promotion. However, the idea was around long before then. See
  <http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp> for details.

  The modern red-and-white image of Santa derives from the poem **The Night
  Before Christmas** (see the annotation for p. 44), first published in
  1822. Coca-Cola adopted him as an advertising symbol in the 1920s, and
  only since then have the colours become 'fixed'. However, it is worth
  mentioning that St Nicholas was a 4th century bishop, who would have worn
  red and white robes.

+ [p. 270] "TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE."

  Desmond Morris, in **The Naked Ape**: "I viewed my fellow man not as a
  fallen angel, but as a risen ape." However, Terry says that he was
  unaware of this prior use.

+ [p. 272] "...pictures of rabbits in waistcoats, among other fauna."

  An echo of Beatrix Potter's nursery stories and their illustrations, most
  obviously Peter Rabbit. The "gold watches and top hats" suggests the
  White Rabbit from **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**.

+ [p. 277] "AND GOODNIGHT, CHILDREN... EVERYWHERE."

  "Uncle Mac", the BBC presenter of the popular 1950 radio programme
  "Children's Hour", always used this phrase to sign off his show.

+ [p. 281] "One foot kicked the 'Afterburner' lever and the other spun the
  valve of the nitrous oxide cylinder."

  An afterburner helps jet aircraft gain speed by using exhaust gases for
  additional combustion. Nitrous oxide (aka laughing gas) is used as a
  combustion-enhancing speed fuel in e.g. drag-racing cars. Also, nitrous
  oxide, when added to water, becomes nitrous acid.

  All of which might throw light on the oft-asked question: "what precisely
  happened to Ridcully in the bath?"

+ [p. 283] "'as they say, "better a meal of old boots where friendship is,
  than a stalled ox and hatred therewith."'"

  From the Bible: "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
  stalled ox and hatred therewith." (Proverbs 15:17)

+ [p. 284] "'And god bless us, every one,' said Arnold Sideways."

  This is the last line of Dickens' **A Christmas Carol**, spoken by Tiny
  Tim, who also had something wrong with his legs.
