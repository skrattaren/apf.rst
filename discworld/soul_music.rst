Soul Music
~~~~~~~~~~

- [cover] The cover of "`Soul Music`_" bears more than a passing resemblance
  to the cover of the album **Bat out of Hell** by Meatloaf, one of the 70s
  best-selling rock albums.

- [p. 8/5] "This is also a story about sex and drugs and Music With Rocks
  In."

  For anyone living in a cave: the classic phrase is "sex and drugs and
  rock 'n' roll".

- [p. 8/5] "Well... ...one out of three ain't bad."

  With the many Meatloaf references in "`Soul Music`_" it is perhaps no
  surprise many people think they've spotted another one here, namely to
  the ballad 'Two Out of Three Ain't Bad' on **Bat out of Hell**.

  But in this case both Terry and Meatloaf are simply using a normal
  English phrase that's been around for ages. There is no connection.

- [p. 9/7] "A dark, stormy night."

  "It was a dark and stormy night" has entered the English language as
  *the* canonical opening sentence for bad novels. Snoopy in **Peanuts**
  traditionally starts his novels that way, and Terry and Neil used it on
  p. 11/viii of "`Good Omens`_" as well.

  I never knew, however, that the phrase actually has its origin in an
  existing 19th century novel called **Paul Clifford** by Edward George Earle
  Bulwer-Lytton. Someone kindly mailed me the full opening sentence to that
  novel, and only then did I understand how the phrase came by its bad
  reputation:

  "It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents – except at
  occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
  swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling
  along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps
  that struggled against the darkness."

  There even exists a Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which people try to
  write the worst possible opening sentences for imaginary novels. The
  entries for the 1983 edition of the contest were compiled by Scott Rice
  in a book titled, what else, **It Was a Dark and Stormy Night**. I am told
  that there were at least three such compilations released.

- [p. 13/10] "It was always raining in Llamedos."

  Llamedos is 'sod em all' backwards. This is a reference to the town of
  Llareggub in Dylan Thomas' short prose piece **Quite Early One Morning**.
  That story was later expanded into **Under Milk Wood**, a verse play
  scripted for radio. In that version the name of the town was changed to
  the slightly less explicit Llaregyb.

  Apart from that, Llamedos is instantly recognisable to the British as the
  Discworld version of Wales. The double-l is a consonant peculiar to the
  Celtic language (from which Welsh is descended), hence also Buddy's habit
  of doubling all l's when he speaks.

- [p. 14/10] "[...] a fizzing fuse and Acme Dynamite Company written on the
  side."

  Acme is an often used 'generic' company name in American cartoons.
  Particularly, most of the ingenious technical and military equipment Wile
  E. Coyote uses in his attempts to capture the Roadrunnner is purchased
  from Acme.

  One of my proofreaders tells me he has a Pink Floyd **Dark Side of the
  Moon** t-shirt manufactured by ACME. Make of that what you will.

- [p. 14/11] "The harp was fresh and bright and already it sang like a
  bell."

  Chuck Berry's 'Johnny B. Goode' is, with the possible exception of
  'Louie, Louie', the greatest rock 'n roll song of all time. It begins:

    |   Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
    |   Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
    |   There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
    |   Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
    |   He never ever learned to read or write so well,
    |   But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

- [p. 17/13] "WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? SERIOUSLY? WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO
  IT?"

  This philosophical question was of course first posed by none other than
  the famous Ephebian philosopher Didactylos, in "`Small Gods`_".

- [p. 20/15] "As far as looks were concerned, Susan had always put people
  in mind of a dandelion on the point of telling the time."

  To begin with, in order to understand the dandelion reference, read the
  annotation for p. 10/10 of "`The Light Fantastic`_".

  Next, many people on a.f.p. have been wondering if Susan was perhaps
  based on somebody specific, especially since Terry describes her
  appearance in such great detail. Various candidates were suggested,
  ranging from Neil Gaiman's Death (from his **Sandman** stories) to Siouxsie
  Sioux (singer for the Goth band Siouxsie and the Banshees), to Dr Who's
  granddaughter.

  Terry replied:

  "As far as I'm aware, the Death/Dr Who 'coincidences' are in the mind of
  the beholders :-) Death can move through space and time, yes, but that's
  built in to the character. I made his house bigger on the inside than the
  outside so that I could have quiet fun with people's perceptions – in
  the same way that humans live in tiny 'conceptual' rooms inside the
  vastness of the 'real' rooms. Only Death (or those humans who currently
  have Death-perception) not only sees but even experiences their full
  size."

  "I have, er, noticed on signing tours that (somewhere between the age of
  ten and eighteen) girls with names like Susan or Nicola metamorphose into
  girls with names like Susi, Suzi, Suzie, Siouxsie, Tsuzi, Zuzi and Niki,
  Nicci, Nikki and Nikkie (this is in about the same time period as boys
  with names like Adrian and Robert become boys with names like Crash and
  Frab). This is fine by me, I merely chronicle the observation. I've
  always had a soft spot for people who want to redesign their souls.

  She got the name because it's the one that gets the most variation, and
  got the hairstyle because it's been a nice weird hairstyle ever since the
  Bride of Frankenstein. She's not based on anyone, as far as I know –
  certainly not Neil's Death, who is supercool and by no means a
  necronerd."

  I agree with Terry about Neil's Death. She's a babe. Go read the books.

- [p. 25/19] "I REMEMBER EVERYTHING. [...] EVERY LITTLE DETAIL. AS IF IT
  HAPPENED ONLY YESTERDAY."

  Jim Steinman is the song-writing and production genius behind rock star
  Meatloaf. In 1977 he wrote the all-time classic 'Paradise by the
  Dashboard Light', which opens with the lines:

    |   Well, I remember every little thing
    |   as if it happened only yesterday.
    |   Parking by the lake
    |   And there was not another car in sight

  In 1981, Steinman recorded the album **Bad For Good** by himself (he either
  had a falling out with Meatloaf or the latter had voice problems at the
  time – the story is not clear on this point) but in any case Steinman
  had originally intended the album as a Meatloaf project, but eventually
  decided to use his own vocals). On that album appeared a song (soliloquy,
  really), called 'Love and Death and an American Guitar', which begins
  similar to 'Paradise', but quickly goes off in an *entirely* different
  direction:

    |   I remember every little thing
    |   as if it happened only yesterday.
    |   I was barely seventeen
    |   and I once killed a boy with a Fender guitar

  When "`Soul Music`_" came out, it immediately became a question of utmost
  importance (no, I don't know why, either) to Pratchett annotators all
  over the world to find out whether Terry based Death's outburst on the
  original Meatloaf track, or on the later Steinman song.

  Eventually, somebody attended a book signing and asked Terry then and
  there. The answer: Terry's source was Jim Steinman's own version of the
  song.

  I suppose I might as well mention the rest of the story while I'm at it,
  or else my mailbox will start filling up again: in 1993, Steinman and
  Meatloaf finally teamed up together again and recorded the album **Bat out
  of Hell II – Back to Hell**. The track called 'Wasted Youth' turned out
  to be a re-recording of 'American Guitar', but it is still recited by Jim
  Steinman himself.

- [p. 26/20] "I MAY BE SOME TIME, said Death."

  Terry *likes* this quote – it's the third time he's used it. See also
  the annotations for p. 258/226 of "`Reaper Man`_" and p. 236/170 of "`Small
  Gods`_".

- [p. 28/21] "'You know salmon, sarge' said Nobby. 'It is a fish of which I
  am aware, yes.'"

  A parody of the History Today sketches by Newman & Baddiel, where two old
  professors use a discussion on history to insult each other. These often
  started with a similar style of exchange along the lines of: "Do you know
  the industrial revolution?" "It is a period of history of which I am
  aware, yes".

- [p. 30/22] "'Are you elvish?'"

  The way everyone keeps asking Imp if he's elvish resonates with our
  world's 'are you sure you're not Jewish?', but it's of course also a play
  on the name 'Elvis', which eventually leads to the joke explained in the
  annotation for p. 376/284.

- [p. 31/23] "'Lias Bluestone,' said the troll [...]"

  See the annotation for p. 103/86 of "`Moving Pictures`_".

- [p. 31/23] "'Imp y Celyn,' said Imp."

  This gets pretty much spelled out in the text: "Imp y Celyn" is a Welsh
  transliteration of 'Bud of the Holly', i.e. Buddy Holly. Terry originally
  mentioned this name on alt.fan.pratchett without giving the explanation.
  It took the group quite a while to figure it out, but luckily there are
  some Welsh people on the Internet...

- [p. 31/24] "'Glod Glodsson,' said the dwarf."

  As his name indicates, Glod Glodsson is the son of the irritable dwarf
  Glod we learned about earlier in the footnotes for "`Witches Abroad`_".

- [p. 33/25] "[...] what you would get if you extracted fossilized genetic
  material from something in amber and then gave it a suit."

  What Terry means is that Mr Clete is a bit reptile-like. The reference is
  to the blockbuster novel/movie **Jurassic Park**, in which various
  murderous lizards were brought to life using prehistoric DNA found in
  amber-fossilized mosquitoes.

- [p. 35/27] "'Gimlet? Sounds dwarfish.'"

  "Gimlet, son of Groin" is a dwarf appearing in the well known Harvard
  Lampoon parody **Bored of the Rings** by the famous Dutch author Tolkkeen
  with four M's and a silent Q. The original dwarf being, um, lampooned
  here is of course Tolkien's Gimli, son of Gloin.

  In the Discworld canon, this is the first time Gimlet makes an actual
  on-stage appearance, though he has been mentioned a number of times
  before, most notably in "`Reaper Man`_" (see the annotation for p. 31/30 of
  that book).

- [p. 36/27] "'Give me four fried rats.' [...] 'You mean rat heads or rat
  legs?' 'No. Four fried rats.'"

  This is a spoof of the restaurant scene in **The Blues Brothers**. Jake
  orders "Four fried chickens and a coke", and the waitress (Aretha
  Franklin) asks him whether he'd like chicken wings or legs, etc. Even the
  "best damn fried rat in the city" is a direct paraphrase of a Blues
  Brothers quote.

- [p. 36/27] "'And two hard-boilled eggs,' said Imp. The others gave him an
  odd look."

  This is partly a continuation of the Blues Brothers reference (after Jake
  asks for the fried chickens, Elwood asks for two slices of dry toast),
  and at the same time a nod to the Marx Brothers. In the cabin scene from
  **A Night at the Opera**, Groucho is giving his order to the steward
  outside the cabin; Chico is calling out "And two hard boiled eggs!" from
  inside, Groucho repeats it to the steward, then Harpo honks his horn and
  Groucho says "Make that three hard boiled eggs." This happens several
  times, with Groucho ordering a multi-course meal in between. At one point
  Harpo adds a second honk, in a different pitch, and Groucho adds, "And
  one duck egg." At the end Harpo produces a long series of honks in
  assorted tones, and Groucho says to the steward, "Either it's foggy out,
  or make that a dozen hard boiled eggs."

- [p. 38/29] "'I won that at the Eisteddfod,' said Imp."

  The eisteddfod is a real Welsh concept, originally a contest for poets
  and harpists. Nowadays, I'm told, it is more of a generic arts and crafts
  fair/contest, and it has spread as far as Australia, where the annual
  Rock Eisteddfod, according to one of my correspondents, is one of the
  most entertaining and highly competitive interschool activities around.

+ [p. 30] "[...] a thin slice of a face belonging to an old woman."

  (See also the scene that starts on p. 181.) The attitudes and mannerisms
  of the old woman owning the pawn shop are very like those of Auntie
  Wainwright in the BBC sitcom **Last of the Summer Wine**.

  For quite a number of episodes she ran the funny old antiques shop from
  which many props and plot devices were available. When people entered the
  shop, she often appeared holding a double barrelled shotgun and
  describing herself as a "poor defenseless old lady" or calling from just
  off the scene to describe the many (non-existant) security devices she
  has installed. She always charged too much and "It's funny you should say
  that" is a phrase she used a lot.

- [p. 43/33] "Just a stroke of the chalk..."

  I'm not sure if it warrants an annotation, but I was fairly puzzled by
  this bit when I first read "`Soul Music`_". Only on re-reading did it dawn
  on me that what Terry is trying to tell us here is that chalked on the
  guitar is the number '1'. This will turn out to be rather significant,
  later on.

- [p. 46/35] "'You're not going to say something like "Oh, my paws and
  whiskers", are you?' she said quietly."

  The White Rabbit in **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**: "'The Duchess!
  The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers!'".

  Terry doesn't like the Alice books very much, though. See also the "`Words
  From The Master`_" section in Chapter 5.

- [p. 47/36] "[...] 'Shave and a haircut, two pence' [...]
  Bam-bam-a-bambam, bamBAM."

  'Shave and a haircut, two bits' is a classic rock 'n' roll rhythm (used
  in just about everything Bo Diddley did, for instance). It was most
  recently reintroduced to the public as a punchline to a joke in the movie
  **Who Framed Roger Rabbit**.

- [p. 48/37] '*A-bam-bop-a-re-bop-a-bim-bam-boom.*'

  A-wap-ba-ba-looba-a-wap-bam-boom, one of rock 'n roll's most famous
  phrases, from Little Richard's 'Tutti Frutti'.

- [p. 50/38] "'[...] oh, you're a raven, go on, say the N word...'"

  The N word is, of course, 'Nevermore' from Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Raven'.
  See also the annotation for p. 217/191 of "`Reaper Man`_".

- [p. 55/42] "The wizard who thought he owned him called him Quoth, [...]"

  The line from 'The Raven' fully goes: "Quoth the raven 'Nevermore'."

  Quoth the Raven – get it?

- [p. 56/42] "Lunch was Dead Man's Fingers and Eyeball Pudding, [...]"

  Terry explains that this is "based on the UK tradition of giving horrible
  names to items on the school menu, such as Snot and Bogey Pie. Eyeball
  Pudding was usually semolina, Dead Men's Fingers are sausages. At least,
  they were at my school, and friends confirm the general approach."

+ [p. 56/42] "Miss Butts [...] practised eurhythmics in the gym."

  Eurhythmics (literally: "good rhythms") is an existing form of movement
  therapy that originated in Europe in the late 19th century, which aims to
  study the rhythmic underpinning of music through movement (it is of
  course also where pop band The Eurythmics got their name from).

  In its early years, the more philosophical aspects of Eurhythmics were
  not always properly recognised, which often led to classes that were,
  according to one author, "little more than 'the place were the rich girls
  from the village went to learn dancing'", which of course ties in neatly
  with the Quirm College for Young Girls.

  Note that Miss Butts' co-founder of the College is Miss Delcross, and
  that the Eurhythmics method was created by the Swiss composer Emile
  Jaques-Dalcroze.

- [p. 63/48] "There's a floral clock in Quirm. It's quite a tourist
  attraction."

  A flower display common in the more genteel and down-at-heel seaside
  resorts in the shape of a clock face, with the design of the face picked
  out in flowering plants of different colours. The more clever ones use
  flowers which open and close at different times of day, thus in principle
  allowing the time to be told by looking at the flowers. The less subtle
  ones just have a clock mechanism buried in the middle, and big hands.

- [p. 69/52] "There's a song about him. It begins: You'd Better Watch
  Out..."

  The real world equivalent of this song is of course 'Santa Claus is
  Coming to Town'. I just *love* how Terry completely reverses the meaning
  of that song's opening line, without changing a single word.

- [p. 69/52] "The Hogfather is said to have originated in the legend of a
  local king [...] passing [...] the home of three young women and heard
  them sobbing because they had no food [...]. He took pity on them and
  threw a packet of sausages through the window."

  This recalls the legend of the original (Asiatic) St Nicholas, bishop of
  Myra in what is now Turkey, who threw a bag of gold (on three separate
  occasions) through the window of a poor man with three daughters, so the
  girls would have dowries, saving them from having to enter lives of
  prostitution.

  I don't know about other countries, but in the Netherlands we still
  celebrate St Nicholas' day (on December 5th) rather than Christmas. Let
  me rephrase that. We *do* celebrate Christmas, but we have no tradition
  of a fat man in a red suit going ho-ho-ho while delivering presents.
  Instead, we get St Nicholas ('Sinterklaas'), who also wears red, and
  comes over from Spain each year (don't ask) to ride a white horse (not
  named Binky, as far as I know) over the rooftops and drop presents down
  the chimneys.

- [p. 71/54] "Behind it, in the turf, two fiery hoofprints burned for a
  second or two."

  I have received I don't know how many emails pointing out that this
  resonates with the burning tire tracks left by the time-travelling
  DeLorean in the film **Back to the Future**.

- [p. 74/56] "[...] the sky ahead of her erupted blue for a moment. Behind
  her, unseen because light was standing around red with embarrassment
  [...]"

  Binky is obviously going *very* fast, since the visible light in front of
  him is blue-shifted and behind him red-shifted, something normally only
  associated with astronomical objects.

- [p. 75/57] "The Soul Cake Tuesday Duck didn't apparently have any kind of
  a home."

  The Discworld equivalent of the Easter Bunny. See also the annotation for
  p. 193/139 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 79/59] "[...] C. H. Lavatory & Son [...]"

  It is a curious but true fact that we owe the modern flush toilet as we
  know it to a Victorian gentleman by the name of Thomas Crapper. Mr
  Lavatory is obviously his Discworld counterpart.

  And before I start getting mail about it: no, Crapper didn't really
  invent the flush toilet himself, but he made several improvements to the
  design (shades of James Watt here, see the annotation for p. 175/153 of
  "`Reaper Man`_"), and he certainly sold a lot of them to the British army.
  For more information about Thomas Crapper, read Cecil Adams' **More of the
  Straight Dope**.

- [p. 81/61] "'What d'you call this, then, Klatchian mist?'"

  The British expression this refers to is 'Scotch mist', used to describe
  things that persist in being present or existing despite statements to
  the contrary. For example:

      Worker A: "Someone's buggered off with me three-eighths Gripley!"

      Worker B: (holding up three-eighths Gripley allegedly buggered-off
                with by person or persons unknown) "What's this then?
                Scotch mist?"

- [p. 91/69] "'Normal girls didn't get a My Little Binky set on their third
  birthday!'"

  My Little Pony is a toy aimed at young girls: a small plastic pony (in
  bright pink, or blue, etc.) with long hair which you can (allegedly) have
  endless fun combing.

- [p. 98/73] "'You mean like... *Keith* Death?'"

  I doubt very much if this is a true reference, but when I saw this I
  couldn't help thinking: Keith Richards always looks like Death. No reason
  why Death shouldn't look like a Keith, is there?

- [p. 103/77] "'Er,' she said, 'ANYONE HERE BEEN KILLED AND CALLED VOLF?'"

  **Anyone Here Been Raped And Speak English?** was the British title of a
  book about newspapers' foreign correspondents by Edward Behr, who also
  wrote **The Last Emperor**. In the US this book was released under the name
  **Behrings**.

  The phrase refers to a story concerning a BBC journalist in a refugee
  camp in the Belgian Congo. He was investigating some of the atrocities
  being committed there, and was looking for a victim to interview.
  Unfortunately he didn't have a translator and the victims only spoke
  French. Finally in desperation the journalist wandered through the camp
  calling out "Anyone here been raped and speak English?".

- [p. 104/78] "'Hi-jo-to! Ho! Hi-jo-to! Ho!'"

  This is from Wagner's opera **Die Walkuere**. I don't have to explain what
  valkyries are, do I?

- [p. 109/82] "[...] at war with Hersheba and the D'regs [...]"

  The name D'regs is not only a pun on 'dregs', but also refers to the
  Tuaregs, a nomadic Berber tribe in North Africa. The Tuaregs are also the
  desert marauders who attack Fort Zinderneuf in the movie **Beau Geste**
  (based on the book by P. C. Wren).

  The name 'Hersheba' (a pun on 'Hershey Bar' / 'Beersheba') is something
  that Terry came up with in 1992 on a.f.p., when he was more or less
  thinking out loud about the many people who didn't get the Djelibeybi
  reference (see the annotation for p. 17/17 of "Pyramids_"):

  "[...] say Djelibeybi OUT LOUD – I must have had twenty letters (and one
  or two emails) from people who didn't twig until the third time round...
  oh god... do they have them in the US? Should it have been called
  Emmenemms, or Hersheba... hmm, Hersheba... could USE that, yes, little
  country near Ephebe..."

- [p. 109/82] "IS THIS THE KLATCHIAN FOREIGN LEGION?"

  I'll just let Terry himself handle this one:

  "Just so we don't get a zillion postings about cartoon films and comics
  and movies that "`Soul Music`_" has been copied from: the whole Klatchian
  Foreign Legion bit has its roots in 'Beau Geste', which was *the* Foreign
  Legion movie. It must be one of the most parodied, echoed and copied
  movies of all time – it was so influential that it is probably where
  most people's ideas of the FFL originate."

- [p. 112/84] "There was a riot going on."

  This line is a fairly cliche rock 'n roll text fragment. It is used in
  quite a few songs, most notably in 'Riot in Cell Block #9', a song that
  has been performed by everybody from Dr Feelgood to the Blues Brothers.
  **There's A Riot Goin' On** is also the name of a famous 1971 funk album by
  Sly and the Family Stone.

- [p. 116/88] "[...] the Vox Humana, the Vox Dei and the Vox Diabolica."

  The Vox Humana is an existing organ stop (to be precise: a reed-type stop
  with a short resonator, common in baroque organs), and so is the Vox
  Angelicii. But my sources are divided as to whether the Vox Dei actually
  exists. About the Vox Diabolica everyone is in perfect agreement: ain't
  no such thing, and never was.

- [p. 116/88] "He raised his hands."

  The Librarian powering up the organ resonates with the scene in which
  Marty McFly turns on Doc Brown's guitar amplifier in **Back to the
  Future**.

- [p. 117/89] "[...] except the legendary harp of Owen Mwnyy [...]"

  Owen Mwnyy is pronounced as 'Owing Money' (in Welsh, the 'w' is a vowel,
  pronounced as a 'u'). Also, Owen Myfanwy was a Welsh folk hero, and of
  course all Welsh folk heroes are dab hands with the harp, which is the
  Welsh national musical instrument.

- [p. 120/90] "'Cliff? Can't see anyone lasting long in *this* business
  with a name like *Cliff*'."

  A reference to Cliff Richard – see the annotation for p. 48/45 of
  "`Johnny and the Dead`_".

- [p. 121/91] "'Moving around on your seat like you got a pant full of
  ant.'"

  James Brown, the Godfather of Soul: 'I've got Ants in my Pants and I want
  to Dance.'

- [p. 122/92] "They've got one of those new pianofortes [...]' 'But dat
  sort of thing is for big fat guys in powdered wigs."

  Johann Sebastian Bach was invited to Potsdam for the very purpose of
  trying out King Frederic of Prussia's new pianofortes.

- [p. 123/93] "... the beat went on ..."

  'The Beat Goes On' is a song by Sonny Bono (yes, the dude who used to be
  married to Cher).

- [p. 126/95] "'Hello, hello, hello, what is all this... then?' he said
  [...]"

  Stereotypical British policeman's phrase. See the annotation for p. 60/55
  of "`Guards! Guards!`_".

- [p. 127/95] "'He can't stop us. We're on a mission from Glod.'"

  "We're on a mission from God" is perhaps the most famous quote from the
  **Blues Brothers** movie.

- [p. 131/98] "'As soon as he saw the duck, Elmer knew it was going to be a
  bad day.'"

  A nice double reference. To begin with, the cartoons Terry is referring
  to here are Gary Larson's **Far Side** cartoons (which I can highly
  recommend. Just try to avoid the collections published after 1990 or so.
  They're not that bad, but the earlier ones are significantly better).

  Second, there are the eternal cartoon conflicts between Elmer Fudd,
  hunter, and Daffy Duck, duck. Usually, when Elmer meets Daffy, it *will*
  turn out to be a bad day for him.

+ [p. 134/101] "Along the Ankh with Bow, Rod and Staff with a Knob on the
  End"

  Not a reference to anything specific, but there used to be dozens of
  travel books with names like "Along the [fill in river] with [gun and
  camera, rod and line, etc]", usually written by retired Victorian army
  men.

  These cliche-ridden travelogues were already being parodied as early as
  1930 by George Chappell in his **Through the Alimentary Canal with Gun and
  Camera**.

- [p. 135/101] "'Blert Wheedown's Guitar Primer,' he read."

  Blert Wheedown puns on Bert Weedon, famous for his many "play in a day"
  guitar primers, which are mainly bought by doting but slightly out of
  touch grandmothers for grandsons who'd rather have "The Death Metal book
  of three chords using less than three fingers".

- [p. 140/105] "[...] when Mr Hong opened his takeaway fish bar on the site
  of the old temple in Dagon street?"

  For a full explanation of Mr Hong's tragic fate, see the annotation for
  p. 197/149 of "`Men at Arms`_".

- [p. 142/107] "'We call him Beau Nidle, sir.'"

  Beau Nidle = Beau Geste + bone idle.

- [p. 146/110] "There was a path, though. It led across the fields for half
  a mile or so, then disappeared abruptly."

  This would be a good description of **Wheatfield with Crows** by Van Gogh,
  who took his own life shortly after finishing this painting.

- [p. 151/114] "Her mother's favourite dish had been Genocide by
  Chocolate."

  'Death by Chocolate' is an existing dish, as well as a chain of
  restaurants in New Zealand and Australia.

- [p. 152/114] "MORPHIC RESONANCE, he said, [...]"

  Another reference to Rupert Sheldrake's theories. See the annotation for
  p. 54/45 of "Mort_".

- [p. 161/121] "The next table was occupied by Satchelmouth Lemon [...]"

  Louis Armstrong's nickname was Satchmo, which was short for Satchelmouth.
  The 'Lemon' part of the name also ties in with black artists by way of
  the legendary bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson.

- [p. 162/122] "She was quite attractive in a skinny way, Ridcully thought.
  What was the tomboy word? Gammon, or something."

  Gammon is the lower end of a side of bacon. What Ridcully is thinking of
  is the word 'gamine', which does have the same meaning as tomboy.

- [p. 163/123] "'It looks like a spike at the front and a duck's arse,
  excuse my Klatchian, at the back.'"

  "Duck's arse" is, in fact, the correct name for the type of fifties' rock
  'n roll haircut more politely described as a duck *tail* haircut: one
  with the hair long in the back.

  "Excuse my French" is a euphemism, said after swearing.

- [p. 169/127] "'A song about Great Fiery Balls. [...] Couldn't really make
  out the words, the reason bein', the piano exploded.'"

  Jerry Lee Lewis used to set fire to his piano using gasoline while
  playing his immortal 'Great balls of Fire'.

- [p. 173/130] "[...] much later on, on the day when the music died, [...]"

  The day of the infamous plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, the Big
  Bopper and Ritchie Valens all in one go is commonly referred to as "the
  day the music died". Years later, Don McLean would immortalise the phrase
  even further in his song 'American Pie', but that song is definitely
  *not* the original source.

- [p. 173/130] "Ridcully was going to say, oh, you're a rebel, are you,
  what are you rebelling against, and he'd say... he'd say something pretty
  damn memorable, that's what he'd do!"

  In the 1954 movie **The Wild One**, starring Marlon Brando as Johnny, the
  following exchange occurs:

      Girl in a bar: So Johnny, what're you rebelling against?
      Johnny: What've you got?

- [p. 173/130] "'mumblemumblemumble', said the Dean defiantly, a rebel
  without a pause."

  The name of the classic movie is **Rebel Without A Cause**. Starring
  James... Dean.

- [p. 174/131] Song Titles.

  'Don't Tread On My New Blue Boots' is Carl Perkins' 'Blue Suede Shoes',
  'Good Gracious Miss Polly' is Little Richard's 'Good Golly Miss Molly'
  and 'Sto Helit Lace' is the Big Bopper's 'Chantilly Lace'.

- [p. 174/131] "'That bit where you said "hello, baby",' he said. 'Why'd
  you do that?'"

  'Chantilly Lace' begins with The Big Bopper treating us to his half of a
  telephone conversation with the young lady in question. It starts: Helll-
  (then drop about an octave) -lllllo (then up a little bit) ba- (huge
  glissando up the scale, beyond where he started) aaaaaaaaaaybeeeee!

- [p. 183/138] [...] LIVE FATS DIE YO GNU [...]

  After James Dean's legendary motto: "Live fast, die young, leave a good
  looking corpse."

- [p. 184/139] "'Adrian Turnipseed, Archchancellor.'"

  This is probably just a coincidence, but Donald Turnupseed was the driver
  of the car that collided with James Dean in the crash that killed him.
  Donald was only slightly hurt.

- [p. 188/141] "It took him and Gibbsson, the apprentice, [...]"

  That's of course Gibson, of guitar-building fame.

- [p. 190/144] "'I'll throw in the space between the strings for free,
  OK?'"

  Another Blues Brothers reference. When Elwood and Jake are buying their
  instruments from 'Ray's Music Exchange', Ray Charles makes the comment
  about the electric piano that he'll "throw in the black notes for free".

- [p. 192/144] "'[...] if anyone comes in and tries to play [...] Pathway
  to Paradise [...] he's to pull their head off."

  'Pathway to Paradise' is the Discworld version of Led Zeppelin's rock
  anthem 'Stairway to Heaven'.

  The song's characteristic guitar riff is so often played in music shops
  that the patrons get really fed up with it, so it's quite common to see
  "No Stairway" signs, or in the case of one particular shop in Denmark
  Street, London, a sign saying: "Anyone who uses the instruments here to
  play 'Stairway To Heaven', 'Paranoid' or 'Smoke On The Water' should
  seriously consider whether they have a future in rock and roll."

- [p. 193/145] "'They say there's a background noise to the universe? A
  sort of echo of some sound? [...] It wouldn't have to be very loud. It'd
  just have to be everywhere, all at once.'"

  What Ponder tries to describe corresponds to our universe's cosmic
  blackbody microwave radiation, which is indeed a uniform background
  radiation, spanning all frequencies and coming with the same intensity
  from every part of the sky at every time of the day in every season. The
  explanation for this phenomenon is that it is radiation originating with
  the Big Bang that started our universe.

- [p. 196/147] "*This* scene took place in Crash's father's coach house,
  but it was an echo of a scene evolving all around the city."

  Placing them in the coach house is a reference to the "garage band"
  phenomenon.

- [p. 198/149] "'The Cavern!'"

  The Cavern was the name of the night club in Liverpool where the Beatles
  played their first performance. It is worth noting that in "`The Streets
  of Ankh-Morpork`_" we can see that The Cavern is located on Quarry Lane.
  This not only recalls 'Penny Lane', but before the Beatles became the
  Beatles, they called themselves the Quarrymen.

- [p. 198/149] "Gorlick and Hammerjug were songwriters, [...]"

  A reference to the musical composers Rogers and Hammerstein, who wrote
  the songs for **The Sound of Music** (amongst many other musical scores).

  Note also that 'stein' is a word the English (not the Germans) use for
  'jug'.

- [p. 198/150] "Except the one about Hiho."

  The Hiho song is first mentioned in "`Moving Pictures`_"; see the annotation
  for p. 88/73 of that book.

- [p. 199/150] "'And me an' my friends can walk towards you with our hats
  on backwards in a menacing way, Yo!'"

  Rat music = rap music.

- [p. 200/151] "Troll gambling is even simpler than Australian gambling.
  One of the most popular games is One Up, [...]"

  Two-up is an Australian form of gambling played extensively by Australian
  soldiers during both World Wars. Although generally illegal outside of
  licensed casinos, it can now be played in country towns during some local
  festivals.

  Professional games are controlled by at least one 'boxer', who collects a
  'rake-off' or commission from all winners. Bets may be placed either
  between players, or to cover the 'centre', representing the 'spinner's'
  stake. The spinner must back heads, and other players must back tails.
  Side bets may back either.

  Two coins are placed on a 'kip' (a flat piece of wood), and the spinner
  tosses them in the air. If the coins don't spin properly or if they land
  one head and one tail, it is classed a 'no-throw' and all bets stand. If
  both coins land heads or both tails, bets are resolved. Players take
  turns as spinner and may continue to throw so long as they show heads.
  The spinner begins to collect winnings only after throwing three heads;
  subsequently, he may retire or place more bets. However, if the spinner
  'dooks them' by throwing three *successive* heads, the boxer takes a
  percentage (usually about 10%).

  There are a bunch of other conventions, such as calling "Come in,
  spinner" before each throw, and variations in the betting between
  casinos. I'm told that although the odds favour the house (as usual), the
  spinner's odds are better than other players'.

- [p. 201/152] "'I hired you a helper. [...] Meet Asphalt.'"

  In the music scene, the person performing the same tasks for a band as
  Asphalt does is called a roadie. His name is therefore quite appropriate.

- [p. 205/154] "'Bee There Orr Bee A Rectangular Thyng', said Cliff."

  The phrase is, of course: Be There Or Be Square.

- [p. 207/156] "''S called Insanity,' said Asphalt."

  Puns on the name of the British pop group Madness.

- [p. 208/157] "'It says BORN TO RUNE,' said Crash, [...]"

  A combination of the 'Born to Rule' slogan, and Bruce Springsteen's
  anthem 'Born to Run'.

- [p. 209/157] "'That's a bodacious audience,' said Jimbo."

  This may well be a reference to the movie **Bill & Ted's Excellent
  Adventure**, where the two protagonists use this word repeatedly. Later
  on, Crash also says 'Excellent!', another catchphrase from the movie.

- [p. 219/165] "'[...] would they remember some felonious monk or shout for
  Glod Glodsson?'"

  One of my favourite Pratchett puns ever. Thelonious Monk is one of our
  world's most highly regarded jazz musicians (though he played the piano,
  not the horn – you'd want Miles Davis for that).

- [p. 220/166] "'Cavern Deep, Mountain High?' said Glod."

  'River Deep Mountain High', by many considered Phil Spector's last Great
  Production, for Ike and Tina Turner.

- [p. 222/167] "'It's the Gritz for *you*!'"

  That's the Ritz in our world.

- [p. 233/175] "Si non confectus, non reficiat."

  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." See the annotation for the Discworld
  mottos in "`The Discworld Companion`_".

- [p. 235/177] "[...] a small, greyish-brown mongrel dog [...] sat peering
  into the box for a while."

  A reference to the famous 'His Master's Voice' logo for the RCA records.
  The dog is probably Gaspode.

- [p. 237/178] "'You tellin' me ants can count?' 'Oh, no. Not individual
  ants...'"

  An excellent explanation of the anthill as a metaphor for intelligence
  can be found in Douglas R. Hofstadter's **Goedel, Escher, Bach**.

- [p. 239/180] "'I know a golem. Mr Dorfl down in Long Hogmeat.'"

  See the annotation for p. 234/204 of "`Reaper Man`_". Incidentally, 'long
  pig' is a name for human meat (we are supposed to taste like pork).

  Dorfl will turn up later in "`Feet of Clay`_".

- [p. 242/182] "'Are you the Watch?' Glod bowed. 'No, ma'am. We're
  musicians.'"

  The **Blues Brothers** again. See the annotation for p. 122/107 of "`Witches
  Abroad`_".

- [p. 243/183] "'And this one?' he said. 'It'll make the world end and the
  sky fall on me if I give it a tootle, will it?' 'Interesting you should
  say that,' said the old lady'."

  In other words, the untarnished trumpet is actually the biblical last
  trump, which signals the end of the world.

- [p. 245/184] "'There were eight of them, led by... um... Cantaloupe.'"

  That's Calliope. A cantaloupe is a kind of melon. Note that in our
  world's classical mythology there were *nine* muses. On the Discworld,
  this of course becomes eight. For another example of this mechanism in
  action, see the annotation for p. 122/101 of "Eric_".

- [p. 252/190] "'That's mexical, that is. They put the worm in to show how
  strong it is.'"

  A piece of typical Discworld lexical confusion here: the name of the
  drink (and of the associated drug) is *mescal*, the country it comes from
  is Mexico. And yes, mescal is the original drink that has a worm at the
  bottom of the bottle.

- [p. 254/191] "'A-wrong-wrong-wrong-wrong, a-do-wrong-wrong,' said the
  other two maids."

  The maids' chorus and the beehives are like those of the girl groups of
  the sixties; this quote itself is similar to the background vocals in the
  Crystals' 'Da Doo Ron Ron'.

- [p. 258/194] "[...] someone who sat on a wall and required royal
  assistance to be put together again."

  Terry means Humpty Dumpty, from the famous children's rhyme ("All the
  king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together
  again."). From the description he gives it is clear that he is
  specifically referring to Humpty as he was portrayed by Tenniel in the
  illustrations for Lewis Carroll's **Through The Looking Glass**.

- [p. 263/198] "'So you want to be Music With Rocks In stars, do you?'
  'Yes, sir!' 'Then listen here to what I say...'"

  From The Byrds' 'So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star':

    |   So you want to be a rock and roll star?
    |   Then listen now to what I say.
    |   Just get an electric guitar
    |   Then take some time
    |   And learn how to play.
    |   And with your hair swung right,
    |   And your pants too tight
    |   It's gonna be all right.

- [p. 264/199] "'We're Certainly Dwarfs', said Dibbler. 'Yes, that might
  work.'"

  Terry is a fan of a fairly obscure band (in Europe at least – in America
  they are a bit better known) called They Might Be Giants (he has
  mentioned on a.f.p. that their 'Where your Eyes don't Go' is the scariest
  song he's ever heard – not that scary is a word I'd normally associate
  with TMBG, mind you, but then I don't know that particular song).

  Anyway, 'We're Certainly Dwarfs' appears to be the Discworld answer to
  this group, or at least to their name, and it may be amusing to know that
  the name was first suggested to Terry by a.f.p. reader Mike Berzonsky,
  during an early discussion about Discworld popular music. Mike wrote, way
  back in february 1993:

  "Totally off the subject, this came to me last night. Terry's covered
  tons of stuff, but other than metamorphizing tapes in "`Good Omens`_",
  little on Rock n Roll. Since he's a fan of TMBG, maybe a dwarvish rock
  band, 'No, We Really Are Dwarves'. Since rock is so central to dwarf
  life, it makes sense to me that they'd have a band, although I understand
  that rich dwarves hire trolls to bang on anvils, so maybe Detritus could
  be the percussion section. And Dibbler could be their manager. No,
  better, Gaspode the Wonder Dog. And finding the references to the last
  forty years of music could be a blast. Just an idea."

  Was this guy a prophet, or what? Terry replied:

  "I've occasionally toyed with the Ankh music business. And I can promise
  you that if it ever happens, there'll be a group called 'We Really Are
  Dwarfs' :-)"

  The rest is history.

  The song mentioned later on in the text, 'Something's gotten into my
  beard' is not directly traceable to They Might Be Giants, or it would
  have to be to the track 'Fingertips' on **Apollo 18**, which features the
  line "Something grabbed a hold of my hand". Most people figure it is
  simply a reference to an entirely different song: Gene Pitney's
  'Something's gotten hold of my Heart'.

- [p. 264/199] "'But you've got to spell it with a Z. Trollz."

  In the sixties it was common for bands to get their names from
  intentional misspellings of common words. The best-known examples of this
  trend are probably the Byrds and Led Zeppelin.

- [p. 265/199] "'So now we're Suck,' said Crash."

  Suck –> KISS.

- [p. 270/203] "[...] a name like JOE'S LIVERY STABLE, [...]"

  So what we have here is the Discworld version of Joe's Garage, another
  well-known rock 'n roll concept.

- [p. 270/204] "Buddy sighed. 'You had a great house there, I expect?' said
  the troll. 'Just a shack,' said Buddy. 'Made of earth and wood. Well, mud
  and wood really.'"

  'Johnny B. Goode' again. See the annotation for p. 14/11.

- [p. 272/204] "And the one they called the Duck Man had a duck on his
  head."

  In Daniel Pinkwater's book **Lizard Music** a major character is the
  Chicken Man, an apparently homeless man who walks around with a chicken
  perched on his head (under a hat). The Chicken Man is a lot more together
  than The Duck Man – he periodically does little street shows featuring
  the chicken, who does tricks. According to Pinkwater, the Chicken Man was
  based on a real person who lived in Chicago.

- [p. 278/209] "'They follow actors and musicians around,' he said,
  'because of, you know, the glamour and everything –'"

  While it is obvious that Buddy is talking about the phenomenon of
  groupies, it is also interesting to note that the word 'glamour' is
  sometimes used to mean magic spell or enchantment, making this sentence
  tie in nicely with the wizard's earlier beliefs that Music With Rocks In
  is somehow magical.

- [p. 282/212] "'The Surreptitious Fabric', said Jimbo."

  The Discworld version of the legendary Velvet Underground.

- [p. 284/214] "'It's sort of deaf."

  So, in effect they bought a Def Leppard, get it?

- [p. 285/214] More band names.

   The Whom are The Who, The Blots are The Inkspots, and Lead Balloon are
   of course Led Zeppelin.

- [p. 285/215] "'Yes, but a rolling stone gathers no moss, my father says,'
  said Crash."

  Notice how when the opportunity presents itself for the group to pick one
  of the most influential rock 'n roll group names imaginable, Crash and
  friends totally and utterly fail to see it.

- [p. 285/215] "THANK YOU, said the grateful Death."

  A straightforward reference to the band The Grateful Dead. I didn't
  really think this was worth annotating, but people kept sending me mail
  about it, so...

- [p. 290/218] "'Nice curtains, by the way.'"

  This is a reference to rock bands 'redecorating their hotel rooms', i.e.
  thrashing it beyond all recognition. Glod interprets the phrase more
  literally.

- [p. 290/218] "'[...] I'm going to put my rock kit on my back and take a
  long walk, and the first time someone says to me, "What are dem things on
  your back?" dat's where I'm gonna settle down.'"

  In Homer's **Odyssey**, Odysseus was told by the spirit of Tiresias that if
  he ever made it back to Ithaca, he was to put one oar on his shoulder and
  walk inland, until he reached a people who knew nothing of sailing.
  There, he was to offer a sacrifice to Poseidon, after which he would be
  allowed to die after a happy old age, far from the sea.

- [p. 298/225] "[...] somewhere where no one remembers your name."

  Since Death has actually gone to the Mended Drum, it's not too
  far-fetched to assume this is a nod to the theme song of **Cheers**, the
  bar "where everybody knows your name".

- [p. 299/225] "**He built me a swing**, Susan remembered."

  Death's attempts to build a swing for Susan are a Discworld version of a
  cartoon that has been doing the rounds in offices all over the world.
  Usually the cartoon depicts 'swing-building' as an increasingly complex
  series of 'logical' steps representing an abstract process such as "the
  software life cycle". The finished item, looking somewhat like Death's
  completed swing, is typically followed by a final picture showing "what
  the customer wanted", namely, a tire hanging from a branch by a single
  rope.

- [p. 300/226] "'In like Flint, eh?'"

  "In like Flynn" is the normal expression, going back to Errol Flynn's
  sexual transgressions – at one point he was even charged with statutory
  rape, arrested and brought to trial, then acquitted.

- [p. 306/231] "'I can feel it. Every day. It's getting closer...'"

  This is part of the lyrics to Buddy Holly's 'Everyday':

    |   Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer,
    |   Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
    |   Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey hey hey)

- [p. 306/231] More song names.

  'There's A Great Deal Of Shaking Happening' is Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Whole
  Lot of Shakin' Goin' On'. 'Give Me That Music With Rocks In' is Leiber
  and Stoller's 'Rock and Roll Music'.

- [p. 307/231] "'Hah. That'll be the day.'"

  The title of one of Buddy Holly's greatest hits.

- [p. 307/232] "'I'd like a quarry,' said the troll. 'Yeah?' 'Yeah.
  Heart-shaped.'"

  A reference to the strange-shaped swimming pools rock and movie stars are
  supposed to have built for themselves.

- [p. 313/236] "It was called Hide Park [...]"

  A 'hide' is in fact an Old English measure of land. The definition
  varies, but it is usually the amount considered adequate for the support
  of one free family with its dependants, and at an earlier time this in
  turn was defined as being as much land as could be tilled with one plough
  in a year.

  Hyde park is also the name of a largish open space in the centre of
  London where, sometime around 1970, the Rolling Stones played a massive
  free concert.

- [p. 314/237] "'Whoever heard of a serious musician with a glove?'"

  Part of Michael Jackson's image is his always wearing one glove on stage.

- [p. 315/237] "'Dwarfs With Altitude'"

  Reference to the gangster rap group Niggaz With Attitude (NWA), and the
  general concept of "having an attitude".

- [p. 323/244] More band names.

  Boyz from the Wood are Boyz 'n the Hood (which is a movie, not a band,
  incidentally), and &U are U2.

- [p. 324/244] "'[...] proper music with real words... 'Summer is icumen
  in, lewdly sing cuckoo,' that sort of thing.'"

  One of the oldest (if not the oldest) known songs in the English language
  is the 'Cuckoo Song': "Sumer is icumen in, lhude sing cuccu". 'Lhude'
  means 'loud', not 'lewd'.

- [p. 324/244] "'Well, it's got a beat and you can dance to it,' [...]"

  This, usually followed by something like "I'll give it a 92", is a cliche
  made famous by the TV music show **American Bandstand**, hosted by Dick
  Clark in the 50s and 60s. **American Bandstand** was televised daily in the
  afternoon (weekly, in later years) and helped introduce such stars of the
  era as Chubby Checker, Paul Anka and Frankie Avalon.

- [p. 326/245] "'I... won this,' said Buddy, in a small distant world of
  his own. 'With a song. **Sioni Bod Da**, it was.'"

  'Bod Da' is Welsh for 'be good'. Ergo, 'Sioni Bod Da' = 'Johnny B.
  Goode'. See also the annotation for p. 270/204.

- [p. 327/244] "The right kind of name for musicians ought to be something
  like Blondie and His Merry Troubadours."

  'Blondie' was the name of the band fronted by Debbie Harrie in the late
  seventies and early eighties. Blondel was the name of the troubadour who,
  according to legend, went around singing at castles in search of King
  Richard Lionheart.

- [p. 327/247] "Anyone else fancy a hot dog? Hot dog? [...] Hot dog? Right.
  That's three hot d--"

  Another replaying of a Blues Brothers scene, only they did it with orange
  whip instead of hot dogs.

- [p. 330/249] "'Cwm on?'"

  See the annotation for p. 117/89. 'Cwm' is Welsh for valley. (Note that
  the Discworld has a Koom Valley...)

- [p. 340/256] "'We *could* do 'Anarchy in Ankh-Morpork',' said Jimbo
  doubtfully."

  Puns on the punk anthem 'Anarchy in the UK', by the Sex Pistols.

- [p. 348/263] "'It's a masterpiece,' said the Dean. 'A triumph!'"

  Triumph is a British make of motorcycle, comparable in quality and
  history to the Harley Davidson.

- [p. 350/264] "I NEED YOUR CLOTHES. [...] GIVE ME YOUR COAT."

  Death is paraphrasing lines made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger in his
  role as the Terminator. Interestingly enough, the music accompanying the
  scene in question in **Terminator II** is the song 'Bad to the Bone'...

  There is an even more subtle reference hidden here, however. After this
  scene, Death will be riding towards the site of the crash in "a coat he
  borrowed from [the] Dean", and that is another line from Don McLean's
  'American Pie' (see the annotation for p. 173/130). Terry has confirmed
  on a.f.p. that the reference is indeed intentional.

- [p. 350/264] "The flower-bed erupted.'"

  This is the written counterpart to Josh Kirby's cover painting, and
  likewise a Discworld version of Meatloaf's **Bat out of Hell**, both the
  album sleeve and the song.

- [p. 352/266] "'He... he had a rose in his teeth, sarge.'"

  A reference to the Skull and Roses motifs used for many of the Grateful
  Dead's album covers and concert posters.

+ [p. 363/274] "He held up a hand. It was transparent."

  Another resonance with the first **Back to the Future** movie. When the
  timelines start to converge, and Marty is also on the verge of being
  erased from the one he's currently in, his hand becomes transparent, just
  as he's playing (wait for it)... 'Johnny B. Goode'.

+ [p. 363/274] "There was a roar like the scream of a camel who has just
  seen two bricks."

  See the annotation for p. 221 of "Pyramids_".

- [p. 364/275] "A small fingerbone rolled across the stones until it came
  up against another, slightly larger bone."

  In light of the earlier Terminator references, most of my correspondents
  think this scene replays the one in **Terminator II** where the T-1000
  model Terminator, after having been frozen by liquid nitrogen and then
  shattered, slowly starts to reassemble itself.

- [p. 366/276] "'Please!' she shouted. 'Don't fade away!'"

  'Not Fade Away' is the title of one of Buddy Holly's songs.

+ [p. 277] "'This is your brain on drugs...', said Jimbo."

  An American anti-drugs television campaign in 1987 used the text "This
  is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?" voiced
  over the image of a whole egg followed by one of a scrambled egg
  sizzling in a frying pan. The phrase immediately entered popular
  culture and has since been parodied or referred to many, many times.

- [p. 376/284] "Gloria sighed. 'Sometimes it's hard to be a woman,' she
  said."

  The opening line from Tammy Wynette's torch song 'Stand By Your Man'.

- [p. 376/284] "'I'd *swear* he's elvish.'"

  This paragraph is the culmination of the Elvis running gag (see the
  annotation for p. 30/22), but in order to appreciate it you have to know
  that Kirsty MacColl had a big hit a decade or so ago with a song called:
  "There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis".

- [p. 378/285] "So you're a rebel, little Death? Against what? Death
  thought about it. If there was a snappy answer, he couldn't think of
  one."

  See the annotation for p. 173/130.
