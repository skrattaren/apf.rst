The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ **The Amazing Maurice** presents a new take on the old fairy tale of **The
  Pied Piper of Hamelin**.

+ [p. 9] **Mr Bunnsy Has an Adventure**

  Mr Bunnsy's adventures are a parody of the Beatrix Potter **Peter Rabbit**
  children's stories, most of which concern fluffy animals being rather
  nice to each other.

+ [p. 9] "Rats! They chased the dogs and bit the cats, they –"

  An allusion to Robert Browning's well known 1842 version of **The Pied
  Piper of Hamelin**:

    |   Rats!
    |   They fought the dogs and killed the cats,
    |   And bit the babies in the cradles,
    |   And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
    |   And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,
    |   Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
    |   Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
    |   And even spoiled the women's chats
    |   By drowning their speaking
    |   With shrieking and squeaking
    |   In fifty different sharps and flats.

+ [p. 58] "The thick line, where she'd pressed heavily, had to mean 'no'."

  I have no idea if this is what Terry had in mind, but in formal logic one
  of the possible ways to indicate the negation of a proposition 'p' (i.e.
  turn it into the opposite statement "*not* 'p'") is indeed to write 'p'
  with a horizontal bar on top of it.

+ [p. 69] "Of all the kitchens in all the town he could turn up in, he's
  turned up in this one."

  *Casablanca* reference. See the annotation for p. 51/48 of "Sourcery_".

+ [p. 77] "'Haven't you heard of the Sisters Grim? Agoniza and Eviscera
  Grim? [...]'"

  The Discworld versions of our Brothers Grimm. See also the annotation for
  p. 21 of "`Thief of Time`_".

+ [p. 87] "'[...] four children and a dog, which is the right number for an
  adventure, [...]'"

  A reference to Enid Blyton's **Famous Five** stories. See also the
  annotation for p. 127/80 of "`Good Omens`_".

+ [p. 90] "[...] the doubting rat, who was called Tomato."

  Note that 'Tomato' is about as close as you can get to 'Thomas' (i.e. the
  proverbial 'Doubting Thomas') when you choose your name from food
  labels...

+ [p. 106] "'[...] the Acme Poison Company [...]'"

  The Acme company rears its head again. See the annotation for p. 14/10 of
  "`Soul Music`_".

+ [p. 182] "'[...] of course everyone knows about Dick Livingstone and his
  wonderful cat, don't they?'"

  Dick Livingstone is an amalgam of Dick Whittington and Ken Livingstone.

  Dick Whittington is a character in British pantomime, loosely based on
  the real-life Richard Whittington. Dick is a boy from a poor family who
  sets out for London to make his fortune, accompanied by his cat. At one
  point he loses heart and turns to go back home, but then he hears the
  bells of London ringing out, saying: "Turn again, Dick Whittington, three
  times Lord Mayor of London." The real Richard Whittington was mayor of
  London under Richard II in the late 14th century.

  One of Ken Livingstone's first acts as new mayor of London after being
  elected in 2000, was to get rid of the famous pigeons from Trafalgar
  Square. He did not get his cat to eat them (at least not as far as is
  known), but he just removed the street-traders who sold bags of bird-feed
  to tourists there – if pigeons don't get limitless food, you stop
  getting huge flocks in one place.

+ [p. 226] "Sergeant Doppelpunkt [...]"

  Translated back from German to English, 'Doppelpunkt' means 'Colon' (as
  in the punctuation, not the digestive tract). Corporal Knopf, who makes
  his appearance on the next page has a name that translates back to
  'Knob'. So, it appears we are dealing with the Uberwald equivalents of
  Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs...

+ [p. 227] "'We fight dogs and we chase cats...'"

  A singing cadence call-and-response song in the time-honoured military
  tradition. Also another reference to Browning's poem (see the annotation
  for p. 9).
