Equal Rites
~~~~~~~~~~~

- A central theme of this book (as well as of the other Discworld witch
  novels) is the contrast between on one side the (female) witches or
  wiccans, who are in touch with nature, herbs and headology, and on the
  other side the (male) wizards who are very ceremonial and use elaborate,
  mathematics-like tools and rituals. This conflict rather closely mirrors
  a long-standing feud between occult practitioners in our real world. (And
  all the infighting within each camp occurs in real life, as well.)

  My source for this also mentions that Pratchett's witches, especially,
  are obvious stereotypes of the kinds of people one can run into at wiccan
  festivals.

- "Only dumb redheads in Fifties' sitcoms are wacky."

  Refers to Lucille Ball from **I Love Lucy** fame.

- One of my correspondents recalls that he interviewed Terry in 1987 for a
  university magazine. In that interview Terry said that one thing which
  had tickled him about Josh Kirby's artwork for the "`Equal Rites`_" cover
  was that it subliminally (accidentally?) reflected the Freudian overtones
  of the book (references to "hot dreams", the angst of adolescence, things
  that might be called "magic" envy)... Kirby's artwork "coincidentally"
  draws Esk with the broom handle where a penis would be (traditionally
  supposed to be the basis of the "witches flying around on broomsticks"
  myth).

- Kirby caricatures himself as the pointy-eared wizard on the back cover –
  anyone who has seen his picture in **The Josh Kirby Posterbook** can
  confirm this.

- [p. -/5] "Thanks to Neil Gaiman, who loaned us the last surviving copy of
  the **Liber Paginarum Fulvarum**, [...]"

  Neil Gaiman is the author of the acclaimed **Sandman** comics series, as
  well as Terry's co-author on "`Good Omens`_".

  **Liber Paginarum Fulvarum** is a dog-Latin title that translates to **Book
  of Yellow Pages**, i.e. not the **Book of the Dead**, but rather the
  **Phonebook of the Dead**. The book appears in "`Good Omens`_" as well as in
  **Sandman**, where it is used in an attempt to summon Death (although the
  colourist didn't get the joke and simply coloured the pages brown). Terry
  said (when questioned about it in a "`Good Omens`_" context):

  "Liber Paginarum Fulvarum is a kind of shared gag. It's in the dedication
  of "`Equal Rites`_", too. Although I think we've got the shade of yellow
  wrong – I think there's another Latin word for a kind of yellow which is
  closer to the Yellow Pages colour."

  The other word for yellow Terry is thinking of may possibly be 'gilvus',
  or 'croceus', or 'luteus'.

- [p. 8/10] "[...] up here in the Ramtop Mountains [...]"

  RAMTOP was the name of a system variable in the old Sinclair Spectrum
  computers.

- [p. 45/45] "'I've seen the thundergods a few times,' said Granny, 'and
  Hoki, of course.'"

  The name Hoki derives from 'hokey' in combination with the Norse god
  Loki. The description of Hoki is pure Pan, however.

- [p. 73/73] "According to the standard poetic instructions one should move
  through a fair like the white swan at evening moves o'er the bay, [...]"

  These instructions stem in fact from a folk song called 'She Moved
  Through the Fair', which has been recorded by (amongst others) Fairport
  Convention, Van Morrison and All About Eve:

    |   My young love said to me, 'My mother won't mind
    |   And my father won't slight you for your lack of kine'.
    |   And she stepped away from me and this she did say,
    |   'It will not be long now till our wedding day'

    |   She stepped away from me and she moved through the fair
    |   And fondly I watched her move here and move there
    |   And she made her way homeward with one star awake
    |   As the swan in the evening moves over the lake

- [p. 79/79] "'Gypsies always come here for the fair, [...]'"

  Someone on alt.fan.pratchett pointed out that in our world, Gypsies were
  named because people thought they were Egyptians. Since the Discworld
  equivalent of Egypt is Djelibeybi, shouldn't Hilta Goatfounder have been
  talking about, say, 'Jellybabes'? Terry answered:

  "Okay. Almost every word in the English language has a whole slew of
  historic associations. People on the Disc can't possibly speak 'English'
  but I have to write in English. *Some* carefully-positioned
  'translations' like 'It's all Klatchian to me' can work, but if I went
  the whole hog and 'discworlded' every name and term, then the books would
  be even more impenetrable and would probably only be read by people who
  like learning Klingon. I do my best – French fries can't exist on
  Discworld, for example – but I think 'gypsies' is allowable."

- [p. 80/79] "If broomsticks were cars, this one would be a split-window
  Morris Minor."

  A Morris Minor is a British car that non-Brits might be familiar with
  either through the video clip for Madness' song 'Driving in my car', or
  through the TV series **Lovejoy**. In that series, Lovejoy's car 'Miriam'
  is a Morris Minor. For the rest of you, here's a description:

  Imagine a curvaceous jelly-mould in the shape of a crouching rabbit, like
  Granny used to use. Turn it open-side-down and fit four wheels, near the
  corners. On the rabbit's back build a cabin, with picture windows and a
  windscreen in two parts at an angle to each other. Add turn indicators
  consisting of little arms which flip out of the body at roof level, just
  behind the doors. Furnish the cabin in a post-War austerity style, and
  power the result with a 1935 vintage 850cc straight four engine pulling
  about 30bhp. In its day, in 1948, this was the height of desirability –
  so much so that for its first few years it was only available for export.

  Even in the Nineties, a fair number of Moggies are still going, er,
  strong. You can actually pay a couple of thousand pounds for a good one
  which works, because they're so easy to maintain. And the split-screen
  ones are very definitely collectors' items.

- [p. 111/109] "Bel-Shamharoth, C'hulagen, the Insider – the hideous old
  dark gods of the Necrotelicomnicom, [...]"

  The Necrotelicomnicom is another reference to the Phonebook of the Dead
  (see the annotation for the dedication of "`Equal Rites`_"), but is also a
  pun on the evil book of the dead **Necronomicon**, used by H. P. Lovecraft
  in his Cthulhu stories.

  Bel-Shamharoth is an Elder God of the Discworld we already met in 'The
  Sending of Eight' in "`The Colour of Magic`_". C'hulagen is obviously made
  up out of the same ingredients as C'thulhu, and the Insider refers to the
  unnamed narrator of Lovecraft's **The Outsider**.

- [p. 119/117] "The lodgings were [...] next to the [...] premises of a
  respectable dealer in stolen property because, as Granny had heard, good
  fences make good neighbours."

  Terry's having fun with a familiar saying that originated with Robert
  Frost's poem **Mending a Wall**:

    |   My apple trees will never get across
    |   And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
    |   He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbours'.

  And since people keep pointing it out to me I suppose it might as well be
  mentioned here that 'fence' is also the English word for a dealer in
  stolen goods.

- [p. 121/119] "'Mrs Palm,' said Granny cautiously. 'Very respectable
  lady.'"

  "Mrs Palm(er) and her daughters" is a euphemism for male masturbation.

- [p. 122/120] "'Yes, that's it,' said Treatle. 'Alma mater, gaudy armours
  eagle tour and so on.'"

  Treatle refers here to the old student's (drinking) song 'Gaudeamus
  Igitur', written in 1781 by Christian Wilhelm Kindleben, a priest in
  Leipzig who got kicked out because of his student songs. The song is
  still in use at many universities and schools, where it gets sung during
  graduation ceremonies. The actual lyrics are:

    |   Gaudeamus igitur, iuvenes dum sumus.
    |   Post iucundam iuventutem,
    |   Post molestam senectutem,
    |   Nos habebit humus, nos habebit humus.

  Which roughly translates to:

    |   Let us be merry, therefore, whilst we are young men.
    |   After the joys of youth,
    |   After the pain of old age,
    |   The ground will have us, the ground will have us.

- [p. 132/130] The maid at Unseen University is called Ksandra, which puns
  on Troy's Cassandra; but might also refer to Sandra being yet another
  typical 'Tracey/Sharon' sort of name in England. See also the entry for
  p. 106/95 of "`Reaper Man`_".

  Perhaps the fact that nobody can understand Ksandra (because she talks
  with her mouth full of clothes-pegs) is also an obscure reference to the
  classical Cassandra, daughter of Priam of Troy, whom the Gods gave the
  gift of prophecy and the curse of no-one believing a word she said.

- [p. 133/130] "'Hmm. Granpone the White. He's going to be Granpone the
  Grey if he doesn't take better care of his laundry.'"

  You really have to read Tolkien in order to understand why this is so
  funny. Sure, I can explain that in the **The Lord of the Rings** a big deal
  is made of the transformation of wizards from one 'colour' to another
  (and in particular Gandalf the Grey becoming Gandalf the White), but that
  just doesn't do justice to the real atmosphere of the thing.

- [p. 143/141] "[...] the Creator hadn't really decided what he wanted and
  was, as it were, just idly messing around with the Pleistocene."

  Refers to the Pleistocene geological era (a few dozen million years or so
  ago), but also to Plasticine, a brand name that has become (at least in
  Britain, Australia and New Zealand) a generic name for the modeling clay
  children play with.

- [p. 163/159] Some folks thought they recognised the duel between Granny
  Weatherwax and Archchancellor Cutangle from T. H. White's description of
  a similar duel in his **Arthur, The Once and Future King** (also depicted
  as a very funny fragment in Disney's **The Sword in the Stone**, which was
  an animation film based on this book). However, Terry says:

  "The magical duel in "`Equal Rites`_" is certainly not lifted from T. H.
  White. Beware of secondary sources. Said duel (usually between a man and
  a woman, and often with nice Freudian touches to the things they turn
  into) has a much longer history; folkies out there will probably know it
  as the song 'The Two Magicians'."

- [p. 176/172] "'Million-to-one chances,' she said, 'crop up nine times out
  of ten.'"

  The first mention of this particular running gag in the Discworld canon
  (to be featured most prominently in "`Guards! Guards!`_").

  It is not quite *the* earliest appearance in Terry's work, though: he
  also uses it on p. 46/55 of "`The Dark Side of the Sun`_".

- [p. 188/184] "[...] which by comparison made Gormenghast look like a
  toolshed on a railway allotment."

  Gormenghast is the ancient, decaying castle from Mervyn Peake's
  **Gormenghast** trilogy. See also the annotation for p. 17/17 of
  "Pyramids_".

- [p. 202/197] "'Like "red sky at night, the city's alight",' said
  Cutangle."

  Plays on the folk saying: "Red sky at night, shepherd's delight. Red sky
  in the morning, shepherd's warning".
