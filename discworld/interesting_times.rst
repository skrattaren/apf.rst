Interesting Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [title] **Interesting Times**

  One remarkable thing about this book's title is that it changed at least
  twice since Terry began working on it. It started out as **Unclear
  Physics**, then became **Imperial Wizard** for a few days, and finally ended
  up as **Interesting Times**:

  "Rincewind and Cohen are having such fun – that is to say, death and
  terror attend them at every step – on the Counterweight Continent and
  the Forbidden City of the Agatean Empire that it might well end up being
  called: **Imperial Wizard** ...which ought to sell well in the US. In some
  States, anyway."

  "The editor and my main beta-test reader have raised objections to the
  title **Unclear Physics**. They think it's a lovely title but they don't
  think it's a good one for this book. Nor do I, because I've got a better
  use for it – I've realised how to utilize the squash court in UU... So
  it will be the original working title: **Interesting Times**. At least for
  this week."

- [p. 9/7] "'I accuse the High Priest of the Green Robe in the library with
  the double-handed axe.'"

  Fate and the other Gods are playing the Discworld variant of the board
  game **Clue** (known as **Cluedo** outside North America).

  The object of this game is to deduce not only which of several suspects
  has murdered the unfortunate 'Mr X', but also what weapon was used, and
  in which room of the mansion the murder took place. Once you think you've
  figured it out you have to publicly 'accuse' the murderer, just as Fate
  does, and if you're right you win the game.

  Although a Reverend Green is one of the suspects, and the Library is one
  of the possible rooms, the game does not feature a double-handed axe,
  last time I looked.

- [p. 10/8] "Let a game begin,' said the Lady."

  I'm a bit surprised at having to annotate this, but apparently not
  everyone recognises just who the Lady is. She is of course none other
  than Lady Luck, who was first introduced in "`The Colour of Magic`_", and
  who has always had a soft spot for Rincewind, possibly because he never
  relies on her.

  Note that green is a colour often associated with luck (e.g. Irish
  leprechauns).

- [p. 11/8] "The Hongs, the Sungs, the Tangs, the McSweeneys and the
  Fangs."

  The presence of the McSweeney name ("very old established family") in
  this list is used as a running gag throughout the book. It also reminded
  me of James Clavell's Hong Kong novels (**Tai-Pan**, **Noble House** and
  **Gai-Jin**), which chronicle the Asian business empire founded and headed
  by various generations of the Scottish Struan family.

- [p. 13/10] "[...] the mandelbrot patterns on the wings are of
  considerable interest."

  Benoit Mandelbrot is the discoverer of the Mandelbrot Set, a famous
  'fractal', first plotted in 1980. Mandelbrot sets are rather difficult to
  describe in words (actually, they are very simple to describe in words
  only not in a way that most people will understand...), but what it boils
  down to is that a picture of the Mandelbrot set is a kind of mathematical
  painting with many swirling colours interspersed by strange, heart-shaped
  clusters of black. Most people will probably have seen Mandelbrot sets on
  computer screens or screensavers or wall posters. If not, all you need to
  do is catch yourself a Quantum Weather Butterfly and study its wings.

- [p. 18/14] The Agatean Empire.

  There's a nice extra resonance with China here: Agate is a semi-precious
  gemstone, originally used in the Orient to make dinnerware.

- [p. 36/29] "'Curiouser and curiouser,' said the Senior Wrangler."

  A famous quote from **Alice in Wonderland**. Not surprisingly, it merely
  confuses the other wizards.

- [p. 44/35] "'To answer such questions Hex had been built, [...]'"

  That a hex is a spell or a curse is well-known, but it may be less
  obvious to non-computer types that 'hex' is also short for 'hexadecimal',
  a common number base used by programmers.

  To belabour the obvious, this conjunction of meanings produces the
  perfect name for a computer designed to analyse magic.

- [p. 44/35] "[...] he was pretty sure no one had designed the Phase of the
  Moon Generator."

  The phase of the moon, besides being undoubtedly very handy when it comes
  to magical calculations, is used in our world's computer jargon to
  humorously indicate a random parameter on which something is supposed to
  depend.

- [p. 45/36] "[...] the ants rode up and down on a little paternoster
  [...]"

  A paternoster (in this context) is a closed-loop elevator of linked
  carriages, somewhat like the bucket chain principle applied to people –
  or in this case, ants.

- [p. 45/36] "[...] the aquarium had been lowered on its davits so that the
  operator would have something to watch during the long hours... [...]"

  A reference to the screensaver programs often found running on personal
  computers to prevent phosphor burn-in of the monitor. One popular
  screensaver module turns the screen into an aquarium of animated,
  swimming fish.

- [p. 47/37] "+++++ Redo From Start +++++"

  A typically obtuse error message of the type that is thankfully going out
  of fashion.

  'Redo from start' is a bona fide error message for the BASIC programming
  language, caused by incorrect responses to an INPUT command.

- [p. 47/38] "The Unreal Time Clock ticked sideways."

  All computers have a real time clock, but, one assumes, an unreal time
  clock measures imaginary time, which explains why it ticks sideways: the
  imaginary numbers are at 90 degrees to the real numbers on the Complex
  Plane.

+ [p. 47/38] '"Out of Cheese Error'"

  In computing, you regularly encounter "out of memory" or "out of paper"
  errors. Presumably hex needs the cheese for its mouse.

- [p. 49/39] "[...] the Bursar, still happily living in the valley of the
  dried frogs."

  The 'dolls' in the movie title **Valley of the Dolls** refers to the pills
  to which the starlets were addicted.

- [p. 51/41] "'Wardrobe? Er... Er... Isn't this the Magic Kingdom of
  Scrumptiousness?' [...]"

  A reference to the Kingdom of Narnia, from C. S. Lewis' series of books.
  See the annotation for p. 22/22 of "Sourcery_".

- [p. 54/43] "'We must storm the Winter Palace! [...] Then we can storm the
  Summer Palace!'"

  The Russian Revolutionary army stormed the Winter Palace in St
  Petersburg, but less well known is that the Summer Palace of the Chinese
  royal family was indeed pillaged and destroyed by the British and the
  French during the Taiping Rebellion of 1860. Terry acknowledges:

  "I had 'storming the winter palace' in mind because, yes, the events of
  the Russian revolution are more familiar to us – and then I came across
  the storming of the summer palace while reading up on Chinese torture. It
  took me some effort not to find some joke about the Taiping Rebellion, I
  have to say... and as for the Boxer Rising..."

- [p. 56/45] "'Your Wife is a big hippo'"

  In "`Interesting Times`_", much is made of similar sounding words having
  totally different meanings. Languages such as Chinese and Japanese pay
  great attention to the pitch and intonation of words, and the same word
  with a different intonation can indeed have radically different meanings.
  (Of course not all different meanings are due to intonation – there are
  other possibilities, such as vowel lengths, and some words just naturally
  have many different meanings).

  Just in case you think Terry is overstating things for comic effect,
  there is an anecdote told by linguist David Moser, who was learning
  Chinese, and was practising with some Chinese friends. He was tired, and
  said "I want to go to sleep now", but got the intonation wrong, and what
  he actually said was "I stand by where the elephant urinates".

  Similarly, I am told that the Chinese glyph 'sento' can alternatively
  mean 'public bath', 'residence of a retired emperor', 'first scaling the
  wall of a besieged castle', 'fighting together' or 'scissors', while the
  Japanese 'kansen' can mean any of 'main-line', 'warship', 'sweat-gland',
  'infection', 'government', 'appointed' and 'witnessing a battle'.

- [p. 60/48] "'Be afraid. Be very afraid.'"

  A famous line from the 1986 remake of **The Fly**, starring Jeff Goldblum
  and Geena Davis, also used as a tagline to promote the movie.

- [p. 61/48] "... *possibly* the finest lager in the world."

  In our world, the advertising slogan of Carlsberg is: "Probably the best
  lager in the world".

+ [p. 63] "The Art of War was the ultimate basis of diplomacy in the
  Empire. [...] No one remembered the author. Some said it was One Tzu
  Sung, some claimed it was Three Sun Sung."

  In our world, Sun Tzu's **The Art of War** is the oldest known military
  treatise (around 400 BC). "Know the enemy, and know yourself" is a
  straight quote from the chapter on Offensive Strategy.

- [p. 88/70] "'The Silver Horde,' said Cohen, with a touch of pride."

  Derived from the 'Golden Horde', one of the successor states to the
  Mongol Empire, based in the steppes of Southern Russia and the Ukraine,
  and ruled by descendants of Genghiz Khan. There was even a movie, **The
  Golden Horde**, starring John Wayne as Genghiz Khan. As my correspondent
  puts it: "Disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead."

+ [p. 72] "'And I was very interested in Auriental studies.'"

  'Aurum' is Latin for 'gold'. This is also why 'gold' is signified by
  the symbol 'Au' in the Periodic Table of Elements.

- [p. 107/85] "[...] a complicated pile of ivory tiles, playing **Shibo
  Yangcong-san**."

  In our world the Chinese game of Mahjongg is played with ivory tiles, and
  its rules have many similarities to certain types of western card games.
  It shouldn't come as a big surprise, therefore, that 'Shibo Yangcong-san'
  is actually Japanese for 'Cripple Mr Onion'.

- [p. 111/88] "'Where's the pork?'"

  In the early 80s there was an American TV commercial for the **Wendy's**
  chain of restaurants, featuring an irate old lady looking at her
  hamburger and ranting "Where's the beef?!". This became a national
  catchphrase for a while, and then permanently entered the language when
  it was used in the 1984 Presidential campaign by Vice President Walter
  Mondale and directed towards Senator Gary Hart as an implication that the
  latter's promises had no substance.

  Terry says: "See? This is probably a genuine joke that Americans *will*
  get and most Europeans won't. Hah! and they said it couldn't be done!"

- [p. 120/96] "'Excuse me, what is your name?' Rincewind said. 'Pretty
  Butterfly.'"

  Apart from her ability to cause as many problems for Rincewind as the
  Quantum Weather Butterfly, Pretty Butterfly's name also resonates with
  that of the operatic Madame Butterfly.

- [p. 142/113] "Bruce the Hoon"

  Hoon is New Zealand/Australian slang for a lout or hooligan. 'Hooning
  around' describes the act of driving around wildly in one's car, spinning
  the wheels and so forth.

- [p. 156/125] "There was a corral, for the Luggages."

  It is obvious that Luggages are fairly common in the Agatean Empire, yet
  in "`The Light Fantastic`_" Twoflower explains that he got his Luggage from
  one of those mysterious magic shops. Terry says:

  "That was a long time ago... think of how it's all progressed. They've
  got real clocks in Ankh-Morpork now, people wear spectacles... you might
  as well say home computers were rare and special things in 1980 so how
  come there were so many of them in 1990? What makes *the* Luggage special
  is its peculiarly endearing character..."

- [p. 172/138] "Then he tugged the sword free and inspected the steaming
  blade. 'Hmm,' he said. 'Interesting...'"

  Lord Hong finds the blade interesting because he has just discovered a
  way to quench red-hot sword blades without oxidising them.

  I am told that traditional Japanese sword makers did actually use
  condemned prisoners, but that was for testing purposes only, not for the
  actual forging process. Apparently, sword quality was sometimes measured
  in terms of the number of bodies the sword could cut through with a
  single blow.

- [p. 221/177] "History told of a runner who'd run forty miles after a
  battle to report its successful outcome to those at home."

  After a successful naval battle at the town of Marathon in Greece, a man
  reportedly ran all the way to Athens, 42 kilometres away, to inform his
  leader of the victory. He is also reported to have died on the spot from
  the strain after announcing their win. This is how the running event of
  the same name was born.

- [p. 230/184] "'Why're their feet so small?' said Cohen."

  Foot binding was a very common practice in China among women of the upper
  classes. As young girls, their feet would be wrapped in painfully tight
  bandages. When the girls grew, their feet did not. By adulthood the feet
  were barely half their proper length, which was considered attractive.
  Thankfully the procedure has almost died out.

- [p. 236/189] "'So there was only blue left. Well, he'd show them...'
  [...] He had to simplify it a bit, of course."

  Three Solid Frogs is inventing the Willow Pattern Plate, the well-known
  blue oriental picture of a maiden standing on a bridge.

- [p. 291/233] "'How lucky do you feel, my lords?'"

  Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. See the annotation for p. 136/124 of
  "`Guards! Guards!`_".

- [p. 296/238] "A seven foot warrior smiled at him."

  In 1974, thousands of terracotta warriors (no two faces alike!) were
  discovered around the tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi at Mount Li, in the Shaanxi
  Province. Huangdi was the first emperor of a unified China (221-207 BC),
  famed for being harsh, autocratic, and intolerant of criticism.

- [p. 303/243] "'Orrrrr! Itiyorshu! Yutimishu!'"

  Terry writes:

  "During WWII Hollywood obviously made a lot of gung-ho war movies. But...
  who could play the Japanese? The Japanese in the US were banged up in
  holiday camps in Death Valley or someplace. So the producers roped in
  anyone who 'looked Japanese' – mainly Koreans, the story runs. The
  actors didn't really have lines since their job was, basically, to be
  shot by John Wayne. In order to give them something 'Japanese sounding'
  to say, some genius suggested they shout, very fast, "I tie your shoe,
  you tie my shoe"...

  I've never dared check by watching the actual movies..."

- [p. 307/246] "It was a grainy picture, and it was in shades of green
  rather than proper colours, [...]"

  Rincewind is wearing the Discworld equivalent of a Virtual Reality
  helmet.

- [p. 307/246] "[...] a row of little pictures lit up on the wide cuff.
  They showed soldiers. Soldiers digging, soldiers fighting, soldiers
  climbing..."

  The icons for controlling the Red Clay Army are immediately familiar to
  anyone who has ever played the computer game **Lemmings**, in which you
  have to use similar controls to guide a group of brainlessly wandering
  lemmings across intricate and dangerous underground labyrinths.

  When this was first remarked upon by readers in a.f.p, Terry wrote:

  "What? Lemmings? Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and
  climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought
  that...

  Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disc, I overwrote it so's I
  couldn't get it back."

- [p. 329/264] "'Friendly stab', as it is formally known."

  The Discworld version of our world's military euphemistic language, in
  which "friendly fire" stands for weaponry accidentally fired at own
  troops, "permanent pre-hostility" means 'peace', and "collateral damage"
  refers to civilians killed.

- [p. 350/281] "[...] a calendar for the year surmounted by a rather
  angular picture of a beagle, standing on its hind legs."

  One of the classic computer programs that circulated in the seventies
  used ASCII characters to 'draw' a picture of Snoopy from **Peanuts**,
  followed by the year's calendar.

- [p. 351/282] "The old blokes say that sort of thing used to happen all
  the time, back in the Dream."

  For an explanation of where exactly Rincewind has landed see the
  annotation for p. 149/132 of "`Reaper Man`_" (just in case the significance
  of the word "kangaroo" escaped your attention).

  The Dream is a reference to the Aboriginal Dreamtime religion.
