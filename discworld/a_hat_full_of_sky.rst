A Hat Full Of Sky
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ [p. 19] "Miss Tick was a sort of witch-finder"

  A neat reversal of the Roundworld witch-finder concept (in the same vein
  as the Witch Trials). See the annotation for p. 167/109 of "`Good Omens`_".

+ [p. 39] "Kelda Jeannie was from the Long Lake clan, up in the mountains
  â€“ and they *did* write things down."

  This could well be the Nac Mac Feegle clan from "`Carpe Jugulum`_". The lake
  they settled at wasn't actually named but, looking at the **Lancre Mapp**,
  it certainly is long. And they do indeed write things down: "We of the
  Nac Mac Feegle are a simple folk, but we write verra comp-lic-ated
  documents".

+ [p. 47] "'There can only be one, is that not so?'"

  Highlander, again. See the annotation for p. 6 of "`Carpe Jugulum`_".

+ [p. 52] "'It's a shamble'"

  On Roundworld, the word shamble has no magical connotations, as far as I
  know. The thing Miss Tick has created would probably be called a focus,
  or a talisman, or perhaps, somewhat misguidedly, a dream catcher.

+ [p. 73] "a dobby stone"

  The idea that stones with holes in them are magical first appeared in
  "`Guards! Guards!`_" On the Discworld, they were first called 'dobby stones'
  in the **Thieves' Guild Diary**, after a con-man called Dobby Stone.

  Here on Roundworld, "dobby stones" are hollow stones with a hole in the
  top, into which are poured offerings of milk to spirits. In Scotland they
  did something similar, offering milk to Gruac, a goddess who watched over
  cattle.

  Stones with holes in are generally considered lucky, and are sometimes
  called hagstones. There are also slightly different stones with holes in
  called brownie stones (a dobby is another name for a brownie). Which
  brings us back to the Nac Mac Feegle.

+ [p. 79] "Professor Monty Bladder's Three Ring Circus"

  It is difficult to believe that a UK humorist could call a circus owner
  "Monty" by coincidence.

+ [p. 93] "The ill-fated First Expedition to the Loko Region"

  The story of this expedition is told in "`The Science of Discworld`_". The
  former inhabitants of Loko seem to have *specialised* in Meddling With
  Things Man Was Not Meant To Know.

+ [p. 136] "Mrs Earwig"

  Mrs Earwig first appeared in the Discworld short story **The Sea And
  Little Fishes** where she challenged a centipede to an arse-kick...
  sorry, challenged Granny Weatherwax's authority.

  In some ways the second half of "`A Hat Full Of Sky`_" is as much as sequel
  to **The Sea and Little Fishes** as it is to "`The Wee Free Men`_".

+ [p. 179] "'It's pronounced Ah-wij,' said Mrs Earwig coldly."

  In the **Keeping Up Appearances** BBC television comedy, the very snobbish
  Mrs-Earwig-like Hyacinth Bucket always insists her name is pronounced
  "Bouquet".

+ [p. 185] "Lovely to look at/Nice to hold/If you drop it/You get torn
  apart by wild horses"

  A sign occasionally seen in gift shops, except the last two lines are
  normally "If you break it/Consider it sold".

+ [p. 230] "'What ha' I done to be among this parcel o' rogues?'"

  Reference to "A Parcel O Rogues In A Nation" by Robert Burns:

    |   Fareweel to a' oor Scottish fame
    |   Fareweel oor ancient glory
    |   Fareweel even tae oor Scottish name
    |   Sae famed in martial story
    |   Noo Sark runs o'er the Solway sands
    |   Tweed runs tae the ocean
    |   Tae mark where England's province stands
    |   Such a parcel o' rogues in a nation

  Much of the rest of Awf'ly Wee Billy's outburst reflects traditional
  Scottish curses.

+ [p. 289] "The Ducking Stool was very popular among young children on such
  a hot day."

  Ducking stool type things *are* popular at modern fairs, but the
  significance of their presence at Witch Trials goes without saying. (See
  also the annotation for p. 62/54 of "`Witches Abroad`_".

+ [p. 317] "'I'm telling you this as a friend.'"

  A phrase Mrs Earwig used to Granny Weatherwax in **The Sea And Little
  Fishes**, prompting Nanny Ogg to think that "Nobody even remotely friendly
  would say a thing like that."

+ [p. 323] "There were no judges, and no prizes."

  In **The Sea And Little Fishes** Mrs Earwig does set up a judging panel,
  and spends ten dollars on a trophy cup. However, given how that turned
  out it's unsurprising she hasn't tried it again.

+ [p. 333] "When I'm old I shall wear midnight, she'd decided."

  "When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple", the opening line of Jenny
  Joseph's 1961 poem 'Warning'.
