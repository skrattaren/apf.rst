Sourcery
~~~~~~~~

- [p. 8/10] "'My son,' he said. 'I shall call him Coin.'"

  A pun on the English boy's name 'Colin', with a nod to the expression "to
  coin a phrase".

- [p. 12/14] "[...] this was a bit more original than the usual symbolic
  chess game [...]"

  This subject comes up every now and again on alt.fan.pratchett, so it is
  time for an annotation to settle this matter for once and for all:
  playing (chess) games with Death is a *very* old concept. It goes back
  much further than either Ingmar Bergman's famous 1957 movie **The Seventh
  Seal**, or Chris deBurgh's less famous 1975 song 'Spanish Train' (which
  describes a poker game between God and the Devil).

- [p. 22/22] "It was quite possible that it was a secret doorway to
  fabulous worlds [...]"

  A reference to C. S. Lewis's classic fantasy story **The Lion, The Witch
  and the Wardrobe**, in which the heroes are magically transported to the
  Land of Narnia through the back of an old wardrobe, which was made from a
  tree that grew from the seeds of a magical apple taken from that Land
  long before.

- [p. 28/28] "'I saw this picture of a sourcerer in a book. He was standing
  on a mountain top waving his arms and the waves were coming right up
  [...]'"

  Probably a reference to a famous scene from the 'Sorcerer's Apprentice'
  segment in Disney's 1940 film **Fantasia**. The "sourcerer" being in fact
  the Apprentice, Mickey, dreaming of commanding the wind to blow, the
  waves to wave, the stars to fall, and so on.

  Some people were also reminded of Prospero in Shakespeare's **The
  Tempest**.

- [p. 44/42] "'Psst,' it said. 'Not very,' said Rincewind [...], 'but I'm
  working on it.'"

  Play on the word 'pissed', common British/Australian (but apparently not
  American) slang for 'drunk'.

- [p. 51/48] "*Of all the disreputable taverns in all the city you could
  have walked into, you walked into his*, complained the hat."

  Paraphrases Humphrey Bogart's famous line from **Casablanca**: "Of all the
  gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."

- [p. 55/52] "By the way, the thing on the pole isn't a sign. When they
  decided to call the place the Troll's Head, they didn't mess about."

  The reference is to traditional British pub names like King's Head,
  Queen's Head or Nag's Head, all occurring quite frequently, where the
  appropriate head (a nag being a horse) is displayed on a sign outside,
  often on a pole before the building.

- [p. 66/61] "The study of genetics on the Disc had failed at an early
  stage, when wizards tried the experimental crossing of such well known
  subjects as fruit flies and sweet peas. Unfortunately they didn't grasp
  the fundamentals, and the resultant offspring – a sort of green bean
  thing that buzzed – led a short sad life before being eaten by a passing
  spider."

  Sweet peas were used by Mendel in his early genetic experiments. Fruit
  flies are used in contemporary genetics. Among the 'fundamentals' that
  the wizards failed to grasp is of course the fact that (a) you can only
  cross individuals *within* each species, not *across*, and (b) you are
  not supposed to use magic.

  With respect to (a) I was told that in 1991 (three years after
  "Sourcery_") an article was published in which a team of geneticists write
  about a certain transposon that seemed to be common to both maize and
  fruit flies, implying that it might be possible to have some form of
  horizontal transmission between vegetable and animal DNA, after all.

+ [p. 68] "*SEE ALSO: thee Apocralypse, the legende of thee Ice Giants,
  and thee Teatime of the Goddes.*"

  In Norse mythology, the "Twilight of the Gods" refers to Ragnarok, the
  final conflict at the end of times between the gods and their enemies
  (amongst which are the Ice Giants). See also the annotation for p.
  308/222 of "`Lords and Ladies`_"

- [p. 69/64] "'Anus mirabilis?'"

  "Annus mirabilis" translates to "year of wonder". "*Anus* mirabilis" does
  not.

  Brewer mentions that the year of wonder in question is actually known to
  be 1666, "memorable for the great fire of London and the successes of our
  arms over the Dutch."

- [p. 71/66] "'From these walls,' said Carding, 'Two hundred supreme mages
  look down upon you.'"

  Napoleon, to his troops just before the Battle of the Pyramids: "From the
  summit of these pyramids, forty centuries look down upon you".

- [p. 75/69] "'[...] that would be the Patrician, Lord Vetinari,' said
  Carding with some caution."

  A sideways pun (via 'veterinary') on the name of the famous de Medici
  family, who were the enlightened rulers of Renaissance Florence.

  During one of those interminable "which actor should play which Discworld
  character if there was a movie?" discussions, Terry gave some insight in
  how he himself visualises the Patrician:

  "I can't remember the guy's name, but I've always pictured the Patrician
  as looking like the father in **Beetlejuice** – the man also played the
  Emperor of Austria in **Amadeus**. And maybe slightly like the head bad guy
  in **Die Hard**."

  The actors Terry is thinking of are Jeffrey Jones and Alan Rickman,
  respectively.

- [p. 76/70] "[...] his chair at the foot of the steps leading up to the
  throne, [...]"

  In Tolkien's **The Lord of the Rings**, the Stewards of Gondor also sat on
  a chair on the steps below the real throne, awaiting the return of the
  king. The prophecy in that case also included a magic sword, although
  Tolkien neglects to make any mention of a strawberry-shaped birthmark.

  Other occurrences of the legend can be found in Robert Jordan's **The
  Wheel of Time** epic fantasy series, in Raymond E. Feist's **Prince of the
  Blood**, and in David Eddings' **Belgariad** quintet.

  This is undoubtedly one of those cases where everybody is drawing on a
  much older idea. Legends about kings, swords and birthmarks are of course
  legion, although I must admit that so far I haven't been able to actually
  find an occurrence of the 'chair below the real throne' concept outside
  of contemporary fiction.

- [p. 76/70] "[...] the sort of man you'd expect to keep a white cat, and
  caress it idly while sentencing people to death in a piranha tank [...]"

  A reference to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of SPECTRE and arch enemy of
  James Bond.

- [p. 88/81] "The market in Sator Square, the wide expanse of cobbles
  outside the black gates of the University, was in full cry."

  The word 'Sator' refers to a famous magic square (magic square, get it?)
  dating back to the times of the spread of Christianity in Europe. 'Sator'
  means sower or farmer. The complete square is:

    |   S A T O R
    |   A R E P O
    |   T E N E T
    |   O P E R A
    |   R O T A S

  This square is palindromic in all directions. The sentence you get reads:
  **Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas**, which means, more or less: "The sower
  [i.e. God] in his field controls the workings of his tools [i.e. us]".
  Some correspondents questioned the correctness of this translation, so if
  anyone has a good reference to something else I'd love to hear it.

  The magic Sator square also has the property that it can be 'unfolded'
  into two "A PATER NOSTER O" strings that form a cross with the 'N' as a
  pivot element (sorry, proper graphics will have to wait until a future
  edition of the APF). The 'A' and the 'O' stand for alpha and omega.

- [p. 107/98] "'And I seem to remember he spoke very highly of the *soak*.
  It's a kind of bazaar.'"

  Punning on 'souk', meaning a Middle Eastern marketplace; and the verb
  'soak', meaning to charge (and get) exorbitant prices.

- [p. 122/110] "the kind of spaghetti that would make M. C. Escher go for a
  good lie down [...]"

  Maurits C. Escher: Dutch graphic artist of the 20th century, well-known
  for his tangled, paradoxical pictures of optical illusions and
  plane-filling tilings. Read Douglas Hofstadter's **Goedel, Escher, Bach**
  for much, much more information.

- [p. 122/111] "'It looks like someone has taken twice five miles of inner
  city and girded them round with walls and towers,' he hazarded."

  From Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem **Kubla Khan**:

    |   So twice five miles of fertile ground
    |   With walls and towers were girded round

- [p. 122/111] "[...] 'sherbet and, and – young women.'"

  'Sherbet' is a cooling Oriental fruit drink (also a frozen dessert) as
  well as a fizzy sweet powder children eat as a sweet, and which comes in
  a cardboard tube with a liquorice 'straw' at the top. To get to the
  sherbet you bite off the end of the liquorice and suck through it. See
  also the annotation for p. 104/104 of "`The Light Fantastic`_".

- [p. 125/113] "'[...] pretty much of a miracle of rare device.'"

  Coleridge's **Kubla Khan**:

    |   It was a miracle of rare device
    |   A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

- [p. 125/113] "My name is Creosote, Seriph of Al Khali, [...]"

  Ok, lessee: Creosote parodies the proverbially rich Croesus (king of
  Lidya – which lies in what is now Turkey – in the 6th century BC),
  'Serif' is a typographical term which also puns on 'caliph', and 'Al
  Khali' is pronounced 'alkali' (just covering all the bases here, as my
  original source put it), but probably refers to the Rub' al Khali desert
  in Arabia.

  Creosote itself is actually the name for an oily liquid mixture of
  organic chemicals, resulting as a by-product from the industrial burning
  of coal or wood.

- [p. 126/114] The hashishim as the "original Assassins".

  The English word "assassins" was originally used to denote a group of
  fanatical Ismailis (a Shi'ite Muslim sect) who, between 1094 and 1273,
  worked for the creation of a new Fatimid caliphate, murdering prominent
  individuals. They murdered prominent individuals; hence, "assassin" in
  English came to mean a politically motivated murderer.

  The name derives from the Arabic "hashashin" – Marco Polo and other
  European chroniclers claimed that the Assassins used hashish to stimulate
  their fearless acts. For example, Brewer writes:

  "*Assassins*. A band of Carmathians, collected by Hassa, subah of
  Nishapour, called the **Old Man of the Mountains**, because he made Mount
  Lebanon his stronghold. This band was the terror of the world for two
  centuries, when it was put down by Sultan Bibaris. The assassins indulged
  in *haschisch* (bang), an intoxicating drink, and from this liquor
  received their name."

  For more information, see also the Hawkwind song 'Hassan I Sabbah' on
  their album **Quark, Strangeness and Charm**.

- [p. 126/114] Creosote's poetry is mostly based on Edward Fitzgerald's
  translation of the **Rubaiyat** of Omar Khayyam. The poem parodied on this
  page goes:

    |   A book of verses underneath the bough
    |   A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou

- [p. 127/115] "'They spent simply ages getting the rills sufficiently
  sinuous.'"

  **Kubla Khan**:

        And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills.

- [p. 127/115] "'Wild honey and locusts seem more appropriate, [...]'"

  Because John the Baptist ate those, according to Matthew 3:4 (also Mark
  1:6): "And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern
  girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey."

  In order to avoid confusion it should perhaps be pointed out that the
  locusts in question are the seeds of honey locust trees, also known as
  carob and (from this story, of course) St John's Bread.

- [p. 127/115] "'You can't play a dulcimer, by any chance?'"

  **Kubla Khan**:

    |   It was an Abyssinian maid,
    |   And on her dulcimer she played.

- [p. 128/116] "'Has anyone ever told you your neck is as a tower of
  ivory?'"

  This, and Creosote's further compliments to Conina ("your hair is like a
  flock of goats that graze upon the side of Mount Gebra", "your breasts
  are like the jewelled melons in the fabled gardens of dawn", etc.) are
  all very similar to the compliments in the Biblical 'Song of Solomon':

        Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
        thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks:
        thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

        Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
        whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
        all shields of mighty men.

        Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins,
        which feed among the lilies.

  I did an electronic search across the entire King James bible for
  "jewelled melons", but those appear to be an invention of Creosote's.
  Fine by me – I was already slightly shocked to find out that "thy hair
  is as a flock of goats" was a genuine Biblical compliment and not
  something Terry had made up.

- [p. 129/117] "Get up! For the morning in the cup of day, / Has dropped
  the spoon that scares the stars away."

  The **Rubaiyat**:

    |   Awake! for morning in the bowl of night
    |   Hath flung the stone that puts the stars to flight.

- [p. 130/118] "[...] a falling apple or a boiling kettle or the water
  slopping over the edge of the bath."

  A falling apple supposedly helped Newton discover the Law of Gravity, a
  boiling kettle helped Watt revolutionise the steam engine (see also the
  annotation for p. 175/153 of "`Reaper Man`_"), and Archimedes, according to
  legend, discovered the principles of fluid displacement while taking a
  bath.

- [p. 132/119] "The Seriph's palace, known to legend as the Rhoxie, [...]"

  No connection to the original Croesus here, but rather to the Alhambra,
  the palace of the Emirs of Granada in 15th century Spain. As Terry says:

  "Incidentally, the Seriph's palace, the Rhoxie, is indeed a 'resonance'
  with the Alhambra – a famous Moorish palace which became a synonym for
  an impressive building, and later became a common cinema name as in Odeon
  and, yes, Roxy."

- [p. 141/127] "Nijel the Destroyer" may be a suitably heroic-looking name,
  but 'Nijel' is of course pronounced as 'Nigel', a name that is
  traditionally associated with wimpy rather than with heroic males.

  I am told that among school-age Australians, Nigel is in fact slang for
  someone with no friends.

- [p. 142/129] "'For example, do you know how many trolls it takes to
  change a lamp-wick?'"

  Someone, somewhere, hasn't heard of the "How many <insert ethnic group>
  does it take to change a light-bulb?"-jokes this is a reference to. This
  annotation is for him/her.

- [p. 142/129] "'[...] it's more than just pointing a finger at it and
  saying "Kazam--"'"

  Captain Marvel, an American comic book character was able to transform
  himself into his superhero alter-ego by saying the magic word 'Shazam'.

- [p. 154/139] "[...] the Librarian dropped on him like the descent of
  Man."

  Reference to Charles Darwin's landmark 1871 book **The Descent of Man**.

- [p. 162/147] "'He asked me to tell him a story.'"

  This is the first, but not the last time in the book that Creosote asks
  Conina for a story. This refers to _1001 Nights`_", and the stories
  Scheherezade had to tell every night to *her* Caliph, Harun al-Rashid.

- [p. 167/151] "'I'm looking up the Index of Wandering Monsters', said
  Nijel."

  'Wandering Monsters' is a phrase that comes from the world of fantasy
  role-playing games such as **Dungeons And Dragons**, and it more or less
  means just what you think it means. Nijel is of course exactly the type
  of stereotypical nerd who would, in our world, actually play D&D.

- [p. 171/154] "'It have thee legges of an mermade, the hair of an
  tortoise, the teeth of an fowel, and the wings of an snake.'"

  More reputable witnesses than Broomfog describe the chimera or chimaera
  (from Greek mythology) as a fire-breathing monster having either the
  hindquarters of a serpent and the head of a lion on the body of a goat,
  or else the back of a goat, the wings of a dragon, the front half of a
  lion, and three heads (one each for goat, lion and dragon).

  Woody Allen somewhere describes a mythical beast called the Great Roe,
  which has "the head of lion and the body of a lion, only not the same
  lion".

- [p. 185/167] "Next to it was a small, sleek oil lamp and [...] a small
  gold ring."

  The magic lamp and magic ring, which summon a demon when rubbed, appear
  in the legend of Aladdin. On p. 208/187 Creosote tells the story of how
  "one day this wicked old pedlar came round offering new lamps for old
  [...]". This is also part of the original Aladdin fairy tale.

- [p. 210/189] "It was a Fullomyth, an invaluable aid [...]"

  Refers to the 'Filofax' system: a small notebook (the more expensive
  versions are leather-bound) with loose-leaf information sheets, diary,
  calendar, notes, wine lists, London underground maps, etc. In the UK the
  Filofax at one time became the badge of the stereotypical 80s Yuppie,
  seen working in London's "square mile", walking around with a mobile
  phone clamped to his ear while referring to his Filofax to find a free
  appointment. Hence the Genie: "'Let's do lunch...'".

- [p. 215/193] "'Like not thinking about pink rhinoceroses,' said Nijel
  [...]"

  I always thought that the impossibility of trying not to think of
  something specific was a general concept, but a correspondent informs me
  that the writer Tolstoy actually founded a club as a boy, which you could
  be admitted to if you managed a test. The test was to sit in a corner,
  and *not* think of a white bear.

- [p. 215/193] Significant Quest –> Trivial Pursuit.

- [p. 227/204] "Other things besides the cream floated to the top, he
  reflected sourly."

  Another Tom Swifty, as per the annotation for p. 26/26 of "`The Light
  Fantastic`_".

- [p. 230/207] "'The world, you see, that is, the reality in which we live,
  in fact it can be thought of as, in a manner of speaking, a rubber
  sheet.'"

  Ovin is modifying Einstein's explanation of gravity for a magical
  setting. See also the annotation for p. 134/128 of "Pyramids_".

- [p. 236/212] "'We are poor little ... unidentified domesticated animals
  ... that have lost our way ...' he quavered."

  'Sheep' was *almost* right. The exact song the horsemen are trying to
  sing goes:

        We're poor little lambs, that have lost our way

        *CHORUS:* "Baaa, baa, baa."

  and is a favourite of the highly drunk.

- [p. 245/221] "'It's not that, then?'"

  In all editions of this novel I am aware of (UK Corgi paperback, UK
  Gollancz hardcover, US Signet paperback) this line is printed in a plain
  font. It seems logical, however, that the line is said by Pestilence and
  should therefore have been in italics.

- [p. 257/232] "'Oh, yes. It's vital to remember who you really are. It's
  very important. It isn't a good idea to rely on other people or things to
  do it for you, you see. They always get it wrong.'"

  Rincewind, nerving himself up to distract the Things in the Dungeon
  Dimensions so that Coin can escape, is anticipating Granny Weatherwax in
  this little speech. The theme is clearly important to Terry from the
  humanist angle, but its roots are in the occult – actively holding in
  mind who and what you are is a traditional exercise in a number of
  mystical teachings. Note that this statement is the result of the
  inspiration particle which hit Rincewind on p. 165/149.

- [p. 259/233] "For a moment the ape reared against the darkness, the
  shoulder, elbow and wrist of his right arm unfolding in a poem of applied
  leverage, and in a movement as unstoppable as the dawn of intelligence
  brought it down very heavily."

  This is a rather subtle reference to the scene with the bone and tapir
  skull in the 'Dawn of Man' portion of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C.
  Clarke's movie _2001: A Space Odyssey`_".
