The Discworld Companion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [p. 18] "In the bottom-left half two croix d'or on a sable field."

  People reported on alt.fan.pratchett that they had found an error in the
  Companion: all the descriptions of the coats of arms appear to have left
  and right reversed when compared to the illustrations.

  But Terry replied: "No, we're not daft... according to Stephen, who
  rather enjoys the byways of heraldry, the designs on the shield were
  traditionally referred to from the knight's point of view, and since he
  was generally *behind* it, everything is reversed. Its makes sense, or at
  least as much sense as many traditional things do. After all, if you're
  left handed you use, from my point of view, your right hand. In the same
  way, an actor exiting 'stage left' is walking off to the right from the
  audience's point of view."

  I can report from my own experience that in the medical world the same
  principle is used. My parents are ophthalmologists, and when they talk
  about a patient's left eye they mean the one that the patient himself
  would call his left eye, i.e. the right eye from the doctor's point of
  view. As a kid I found this very illogical, and it used to intrigue me no
  end. But then, as Terry wrote in a subsequent posting: "Of course it's
  daft, it's traditional".

- [p. 179] "As he wrote in his unpublished MS entitled **The Servant**, a
  sort of handbook for the politically ambitious: [...]"

  Lord Vetinari's handbook brings to mind Machiavelli's **The Prince**.

  Alistair McAlpine (one of Mrs Thatcher's closest advisers) has also
  written a book called **The Servant**, subtitled 'A New Machiavelli'.

- [p. 252] "Wizards of the Disc, known"

  In the list a cross-reference to the name 'Catbury' appears, but that
  entry is not present in hardcover nor trade paperback edition of the
  Companion.

- [p. 254] "de Worde, William"

  William de Worde did not appear in an actual Discworld novel until 2000,
  when "`The Truth`_" was released, six years after "`The Discworld Companion`_"
  was written. His name is a composition of the names Wynkyn de Worde and
  William Caxton. In 1474 Caxton printed the first book in the English
  language, a translation of **The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy**. In
  his career he printed more than 70 books, 20 of them his own translations
  from the Latin, French, and Dutch. Wynkyn de Worde was his successor.

- "`The Discworld Companion`_" contains neat illustrations and heraldic
  descriptions of all the coats of arms of the various important guilds and
  institutions in Ankh-Morpork. (Note: the Mappe also shows a few, but is
  not complete. The Companion also gives the dog-Latin motto for each of
  them, but unfortunately Terry and Stephen provide a translation in only a
  few cases. APF to the rescue. The combined intellectual efforts of the
  Latinists on alt.fan.pratchett (Dylan Wright deserves particular mention)
  were put to the task, and we came up with the following list:
