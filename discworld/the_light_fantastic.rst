The Light Fantastic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [title] **The Light Fantastic**

  The book's title comes from the poem **L'Allegro**, written by John Milton
  in 1631:

     |   Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee
     |   Jest and youthful Jollity
     |   Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles
     |   Nods, and Becks, and wreathed Smiles
     |   Such as hang on Hebe's neck
     |   And love to live in dimple sleek
     |   Sport that wrinkled Care derides
     |   And Laughter holding both his sides
     |   Come and trip it as ye go
     |   On the Light Fantastic toe.

- [p. 6/6] "[...] proves, whatever people say, that there *is* such a thing
  as a free launch."

  The reference is to the saying "there ain't no such thing as a free
  lunch" (also known by its acronym 'TANSTAAFL', made popular by science
  fiction author Robert Heinlein in his classic novel **The Moon is a Harsh
  Mistress**, although the phrase was originally coined by American
  economist John Kenneth Galbraith).

- [p. 8/8] "[...] the sort of book described in library catalogues as
  'slightly foxed', [...]"

  "Slightly foxed" is a term used primarily by antiquarian booksellers to
  denote that there is staining (usually due to Ferric OXide, hence
  'FOXed') on the pages of a book. This does not usually reduce the value
  of the book, but booksellers tend to be scrupulous about such matters.

- [p. 8/8] Many people have commented on the last name of the 304th
  Chancellor of Unseen University: Weatherwax, and asked if there is a
  connection with Granny Weatherwax.

  In "`Lords and Ladies`_", Terry supplies the following piece of dialogue (on
  p. 224/161) between Granny and Archchancellor Ridcully as an answer:

  "'There was even a Weatherwax as Archchancellor, years ago,' said
  Ridcully. 'So I understand. Distant cousin. Never knew him,' said
  Granny."

- [p. 8/8] "[...] even with the Wee Willie Winkie candlestick in his hand."

  This is one of those candlesticks with a flat, saucer-like base, a short
  candleholder in the middle and a loop to grip it by at one side. 'Wee
  Willie Winkie' is a Mother Goose nursery rhyme, and traditional
  illustrations always show Willie going upstairs carrying a candle.

    |   Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
    |   Upstairs and downstairs, in his nightgown.
    |   Rapping at the windows, Crying through the lock,
    |   'Are the children all in bed? For it's now eight o'clock.'

- [p. 9/9] "[...] the Book of Going Forth Around Elevenish, [...]"

  The title the ancient Egyptians used for what we now call the Book of the
  Dead was **The Book of Going Forth By Day**. Note that in the UK until a
  few years ago the pubs opened at 11 a.m.

  If you try really hard (one of my correspondents did) you can see this as
  a very elaborate joke via the chain: Around Elevenish –> Late in the
  morning –> Late –> Dead –> Book of the Dead. But I doubt if even Terry
  is *that* twisted.

- [p. 10/10] Dandelion Clock

  Amongst English (and Australian) children there exists the folk-belief
  that the seed-heads of dandelions can be used to tell the time. The
  method goes as follows: pick the dandelion, blow the seeds away, and the
  number of puffs it takes to get rid of all the seeds is the time, e.g.
  three puffs = three o'clock. As a result, the dandelion stalks with their
  globes of seeds are regularly referred to as a "dandelion clocks" in
  colloquial English.

- [p. 10/10] "'To the upper cellars!' he cried, and bounded up the stone
  stairs."

  The magic eating its way through the ceilings with the wizards chasing it
  floor after floor vaguely resonates with the 'alien blood' scene in the
  movie **Alien**, where the acidic blood of the Alien burns through
  successive floors of the ship, with people running down after it.

- [p. 24/24] "[...] when a wizard is tired of looking for broken glass in
  his dinner, [...], he is tired of life."

  See the annotation for p. 193/158 of "Mort_".

- [p. 26/26] "I WAS AT A PARTY, he added, a shade reproachfully."

  When someone on the net wondered if this scene had been influenced by
  Monty Python (who also do a Death-at-a-party sketch), Terry replied:

  "No. I'm fairly honest about this stuff. I didn't even see the film until
  long after the book was done. Once again, I'd say it's an easy parallel
  – what with the Masque of the Red Death and stuff like that, the joke is
  just lying there waiting for anyone to pick it up."

  **The Masque of the Red Death** is a well-known story by Edgar Allan Poe,
  in which the nobility, in a decadent and senseless attempt to escape from
  the plague that's ravishing the land, lock themselves up a castle and
  hold a big party. At which a costumed personification of Death, of
  course, eventually turns up and claims everyone anyway.

  It is perhaps also worth pointing out that the quoted sentence looks very
  much like a classic Tom Swiftie (if you can accept Death as a shade). Tom
  Swifties (after the famous series of boys' novels which popularised them)
  are sentences of the form "xxx, said he zzz-ly", where the zzz refers
  back to the xxx. Examples:

    |   "Pass me the shellfish," said Tom crabbily.
    |   "Let's look for another Grail!" Tom requested.
    |   "I used to be a pilot," Tom explained.
    |   "I'm into homosexual necrophilia," said Tom in dead earnest.

- [p. 30/30] "[...] the only forest in the whole universe to be called –
  in the local language – Your Finger You Fool, [...]"

  The miscommunication between natives and foreign explorers Terry
  describes here occurs in our world as well. Or rather: it is *rumoured*,
  with stubborn regularity, to have occurred all over the globe. Really
  hard evidence, one way or the other, turns out to be surprisingly hard to
  come by. As Cecil Adams puts it in **More of the Straight Dope**: "Having
  now had the "I don't know" yarn turn up in three different parts of the
  globe, I can draw one of two conclusions: either explorers are incredible
  saps, or somebody's been pulling our leg."

- [p. 34/34] "Twoflower touched a wall gingerly."

  Speaking of Tom Swifties...

- [p. 34/34] "'Good grief! A real gingerbread cottage!'"

  The cottage and the events alluded to a bit later ("'Kids of today,'
  commented Rincewind. 'I blame the parents,' said Twoflower.") are
  straight out of the **Hansel and Gretel** fairy tale by the brothers Grimm.

  If you have access to the Internet, you can find an online version of the
  original fairy tale at the URL:

  <ftp://ftp.uu.net/doc/literary/obi/Fairy.Tales/Grimm/hansel.and.gretel.txt.Z>

- [p. 35/35] "'Candyfloss.'"

  Candyfloss is known as cotton candy in the US, or fairy floss in
  Australia. It's the pink spun sugar you can eat at fairs and shows.

- [p. 35/35] "He read that its height plus its length divided by half its
  width equalled exactly 1.67563..."

  A parody of the typical numerical pseudo-science tossed about regarding
  the Great Pyramid and the 'cosmic truths' (such as the distance from the
  Earth to the Sun) that the Egyptians supposedly incorporated into its
  measurements.

  The remark about sharpening razor blades at the end of the paragraph is
  similarly a reference to the pseudo-scientific 'fact' that (small models
  of) pyramids are supposed to have, among many other powers, the ability
  to sharpen razor blades that are left underneath the pyramids overnight.

- [p. 37/37] "'Hot water, good dentishtry and shoft lavatory paper.'"

  From the first **Conan The Barbarian** movie (starring Arnold
  Schwarzenegger): "Conan! What is good in life?" "To crush your enemies,
  drive them before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women." This
  quote, in turn, is lifted more or less verbatim from an actual
  conversation Genghiz Khan is supposed to have had with his lieutenants.

- [p. 45/45] "'Of course I'm sure,' snarled the leader. 'What did you
  expect, three bears?'"

  Another fairy tale reference, this time to **Goldilocks and the Three
  Bears**.

- [p. 46/46] "'Someone's been eating my bed,' he said."

  A mixture of "someone's been eating my porridge" and "someone's been
  sleeping in my bed", both from the **Goldilocks and the Three Bears** fairy
  tale.

- [p. 47/47] "Illuminated Mages of the Unbroken Circle"

  An organisation with this name is also mentioned in the **Illuminatus!**
  trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

+ [p. 57/57] "The universe, they said, depended for its operation on the
  balance of four forces which they identified as charm, persuasion,
  uncertainty and bloody-mindedness."

  The four fundamental forces that govern *our* universe are gravitation,
  electro-magnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

  The word 'charm' also resonates with the concept of quarks, the
  elementary quantum particles that the strong nuclear force in fact acts
  on. For more information see the annotation for p. 133/97 of "`Lords and
  Ladies`_".

+ [p. 62/62] "'In the beginning was the word,' said a dry voice right
  behind him. 'It was the Egg,' corrected another voice. [...] '[...] I'm
  sure it was the primordial slime.' [...] 'No, that came afterwards. There
  was firmament first.' [...] 'You're all wrong. In the beginning was the
  Clearing of the Throat--'"

  The bickering of the spells is cleared up somewhat by the creation
  passages on pp. 103/85-119/99 from "Eric_". It is quite clearly stated
  that first the Creator did an Egg and Cress (for Rincewind), then He
  Cleared His Throat, then He Read the Octavo (that's the word then), which
  created the world and finally the primordial slime came into being
  because Rincewind couldn't eat the Egg and Cress Sandwich and just
  dropped it on the beach. The Creator subcontracted for the firmament, so
  it isn't quite clear when that came to be.

  "In the beginning was the word" is of course also a biblical allusion to
  John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
  the Word was God."

- [p. 82/82] "'Anyway, I don't believe in Caroc cards,' he muttered."

  Caroc = Tarot. See also the annotation for p. 110/90 of "Mort_".

  A minor inconsistency, by the way, is that on p. 24/24 there actually is
  a reference to Tarot cards.

- [p. 88/88] "[...] what about all those studded collars and oiled muscles
  down at the Young Men's Pagan Association?"

  A reference to the Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA. See also the
  annotation for p. 14/14 of "Pyramids_".

  In our world the YMCA somehow became associated with the homosexual scene
  (I think quite a few people singing merrily along to the Village People's
  disco hit 'YMCA' would have been very surprised to learn what the song
  was *really* about), hence the "studded collars and oiled muscles" bit.

- [p. 93/93] "'Only when you leave, it's very important not to look back.'"

  It's always important never to look back if you're rescuing somebody from
  Death's domain. The best known example of this can be found in the tragic
  legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus went to fetch his departed loved
  one, talked Hades (the Greek version of Death) into it, but had to leave
  without looking back. Of course he looked – and she was gone forever. A
  contemporary retelling of the Orpheus legend can be found in Neil
  Gaiman's **Sandman** series.

  A few people have written and suggested a reference to Lot's wife in
  Genesis 19:26 (who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back
  when they left Sodom and Gomorrah), but the fact that we're talking about
  Death's domain here indicates clearly to me that the Orpheus reference is
  the one Terry intended.

- [p. 104/104] "Rincewind wasn't certain what a houri was, but after some
  thought he came to the conclusion that it was a little liquorice tube for
  sucking up the sherbet."

  A houri is actually a beautiful young girl found in the Moslem paradise.
  For more information on sherbets see the annotation for p. 122/111 of
  "Sourcery_".

- [p. 105/105] "[...] homesickness rose up inside Rincewind like a
  late-night prawn birani."

  A birani is an Indian rice curry.

- [p. 128/128] "'Man, we could be as rich as Creosote!'"

  This is the first mention of Creosote, whom we will later meet as a fully
  developed character in his own right, in "Sourcery_". See also the
  annotation for p. 125/113 of "Sourcery_".

- [p. 133/133] The idea of a strange little shop that appears, sells the
  most peculiar things, and then vanishes again first appears in a short
  story by H. G. Wells, appropriately called **The Magic Shop**. A recent
  variation on the same theme can be found in Stephen King's **Needful
  Things**.

  When an a.f.p. reader mistakenly thought that this type of shop was
  invented by Fritz Leiber (see the annotation for p. 9/9 of "`The Colour of
  Magic`_"), Terry replied:

  "Actually, magically appearing/disappearing shops were a regular feature
  of fantasy stories, particularly in the old **Unknown** magazine. They
  always sold the hero something he didn't – at the time – know he
  needed, or played some other vital part in the plot. And I think they
  even turned up on the early Twilight Zones too. You're referring to a
  Leiber story called Bazaar of the Bizarre or something similar, where a
  shop appears which seems to contain wonderful merchandise but in fact
  contains dangerous trash."

  The Leiber story is indeed called **Bazaar of the Bizarre**. It features
  Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and can be found in **Swords Against Death**.

- [p. 171/171] "'Do not peddle in the affairs of wizards...'"

  See the annotation for p. 183/149 of "Mort_".

- [p. 209/209] "The young turtles followed, orbiting their parent."

  My herpetological correspondent tells me that in our world no known
  turtles give any sort of care to their young. They just lay the eggs and
  leave the hatchlings to fend for themselves, which incidentally helps
  explain why sea turtles are becoming extinct.

  It can be argued that Great A'Tuin is in fact a kind of sea turtle
  (admittedly, a somewhat *unusual* sea turtle), since only sea turtles
  have flippers in place of feet and spend most of their time swimming.

- [p. 213/213] "'They do say if it's summa cum laude, then the living is
  easy –.'"

  Substituting "graduation with distinction" for the Latin "summa cum
  laude" gives a perfectly unexceptional sentiment, but it is, of course,
  also a reference to the song 'Summertime' from the Gershwin
  opera/operetta/musical **Porgy and Bess**: "Summertime, and the living is
  easy".
