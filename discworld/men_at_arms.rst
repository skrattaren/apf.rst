Men at Arms
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Starting with "Men at Arms", the word 'Discworld' appeared on the
  copyright page with a 'registered trademark' symbol appended to it.

  When asked if this indicated a tougher policy against possible copyright
  infringements, Terry replied:

  "Discworld and some associated names are subject to various forms of
  trademark, but we don't make a big thing about it. We've had to take some
  very gentle action in the past and the trademarking is a precautionary
  measure – it's too late to do it when you're knee-deep in lawyers. There
  will be a computer game next year, and possibly a record album. We have
  to do this stuff.

  But – I stress – it's not done to discourage fans, or prevent the
  general usage of Discworld, etc, in what I'd loosely call fandom. By now
  afp readers ought to know that. It's been done so that we have a decent
  lever if there's a BIG problem."

- Someone complained on the net that the picture of the Gonne on the back
  cover of "`Men at Arms`_" gives away too much information about the story.
  Terry replied:

  "Hmm. We wondered about the cover 'giving away half the plot' and decided
  to go with it – especially since Josh got the Gonne exactly right from
  the description. But I'd say it's pretty obvious VERY early in the book
  what sort of thing we're dealing with. That's what distinguishes a
  'police procedural' from a mystery; after all, you know from the start
  whodunit in a Columbo plot, but the fun is watching him shuffle around
  solving it his way..."

- [cover] On the cover, Josh Kirby draws Cuddy without a beard, even though
  it is mentioned many times in the text that he has one.

- [p. 8/6] "But Edward d'Eath didn't cry, for three reasons."

  De'ath is an existing old English name. The De'aths came over with
  William the Conqueror, and tend to get very upset if ignorant peasants
  pronounce their name... well, you know, instead of 'Dee-ath' as it's
  supposed to be pronounced.

- [p. 12/8] "'[...] an iconograph box which, is a thing with a brownei
  inside that paints pictures of thing's, [...]'"

  Kodak's first mass-produced affordable camera was called the "box
  brownie". A brownie is also the name of a helpful type of goblin. And we
  all know how cameras work on the Discworld...

- [p. 20/14] "'Twurp's P-eerage,' he shouted."

  Burke's Peerage. See the annotation for p. 191/138 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 20/15] "'My nurse told me,' said Viscount Skater, 'that a *true* king
  could pull a sword from a stone.'"

  Arthurian legend, Holy Grail, that kind of stuff.

- [p. 24/18] "Silicon Anti-Defamation League had been going on at the
  Patrician, and now –"

  Cf. the real life Jewish Anti-Defamation League.

- [p. 25/18] "[...] the upturned face of Lance-Constable Cuddy, with its
  helpful intelligent expression and one glass eye."

  Columbo had a glass eye (or rather, Peter Falk, who played the part, had
  one). And he was rather short.

- [p. 29/22] "'Oh, _nil desperandum`_", Mr Flannel, _nil desperandum`_",' said
  Carrot cheerfully."

  "Nil desperandum" is a genuine old Latin phrase, still occasionally in
  use, meaning "don't despair".

- [p. 44/33] "'Remember when he was going to go all the way up to
  Dunmanifestin to steal the Secret of Fire from the gods?' said Nobby."

  Reference to Prometheus, who gave fire to man and got severely shafted
  for it by the previous owners. See also the annotation for p. 131/107 of
  "Eric_".

- [p. 44/33] "Fingers-Mazda, the first thief in the world, stole fire from
  the gods."

  The name 'Fingers-Mazda' puns on Ahura-Mazda, or Ormuzd, the Zoroastrian
  equivalent of God.

- [p. 46/34] "'Remember,' he said, 'let's be careful out there.'"

  The desk sergeant in **Hill Street Blues** used to say this in each episode
  of the TV series, at the end of the force's morning briefing.

- [p. 49/37] "'Morning, Mr Bauxite!'"

  Bauxite is the name of the rock that contains aluminium ore. I have fond
  memories of this red-coloured rock, because I grew up in a country
  (Suriname) whose economy depended entirely upon bauxite and aluminium.

- [p. 54/41] "Mr Morecombe had been the Ramkins' family solicitor for a
  long time. Centuries, in fact. He was a vampire."

  In other words: a bloodsucking lawyer, right?

- [p. 56/42] "[...] turn in their graves if they knew that the Watch had
  taken on a w--"

  Only funny the second time you read the book, because it is then that you
  realise that the first time every reader will have gotten this wrong...

- [p. 62/47] "'No one ever eats the black pudding.'"

  Not very surprising at the Assassin's Guild: black pudding is made with
  blood.

- [p. 64/47] "Captain Vimes paused at the doorway, and then thumped the
  palm of his hand on his forehead. [...] 'Sorry, excuse me – mind like a
  sieve these days – [...]'"

  Acting like a bumbling fool, making as if to leave, then smacking his
  head, 'remembering' something in the doorway, and unleashing an absolute
  killer question is exactly how TV Detective Columbo always drives his
  suspects to despair.

- [p. 72/54] "'NEITHER RAIN NOR SNOW NOR GLOM OF NIT CAN STAY THESE
  MESSENGERS ABOT THIER DUTY'"

  This paraphrases the motto of the US postal service: "Neither snow nor
  rain nor heat nor gloom of night stay these couriers from the swift
  completion of their appointed rounds".

  In Tom Burnam's **More Misinformation** it is explained that this quote by
  Herodotus is not really the official motto of the Postal service, since
  there is no such thing. But it is a quote that is inscribed on the
  General Post Office building in New York, and has been construed as a
  motto by the general populace. It refers to a system of mounted postal
  couriers used by the Persians when the Greeks attacked Persia, around 500
  BC.

- [p. 76/57] Capability Brown.

  Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (1715-1783) actually existed, and was a well
  known landscape gardener and architect. His nickname derived from his
  frequent statement to prospective employers that their estates held great
  "capabilities". The existence of Sagacity Smith and Intuition De Vere
  Slave-Gore must be questioned, at least in this particular trouser-leg of
  time.

- [p. 77/58] "It contained the hoho, which was like a haha only deeper."

  A haha is a boundary to a garden or park, usually a buried wall or
  shallow ditch designed not to be seen until closely approached.

  I'm told there's a rather nice haha at Elvaston Castle just outside
  Derby. From the house there appears to be an unobstructed vista into the
  distance, despite the presence of the main road to Derby crossing the
  field of view about 200 yards away. Unfortunately, when the house was
  designed, they hadn't invented double-decker buses or lorries, so the
  effect is a bit spoilt by the sudden appearance of the top half of a bus
  going past from time to time.

- [p. 88/66] "'I think perhaps Lance-Constable Angua shouldn't have another
  go with the longbow until we've worked out how to stop her... her getting
  in the way.'"

  The Amazons of legend had a famously cutting way of solving this
  particular problem...

- [p. 94/71] "There's a bar like it in every big city. It's where the
  coppers drink."

  Quite stereotypical of course, but the bar from the TV series **Hill
  Street Blues** is the one that I was immediately reminded of.

- [p. 94/71] "'That's three beers, one milk, one molten sulphur on coke
  with phosphoric acid –'"

  Phosphoric acid is in fact an ingredient of Coca Cola. It's part of the
  0.5 % that isn't water or sugar.

- [p. 94/71] "'A Slow Comfortable Double-Entendre with Lemonade.'"

  There is an existing cocktail called a 'Slow Comfortable Screw', or, in
  its more advanced incarnation, a 'A Long Slow Comfortable Screw Up
  against the Wall'.

  This drink consists of Sloe Gin (hence the 'slow'), Southern Comfort
  (hence the 'comfortable'), Orange Juice (which is what makes a
  screwdriver a screwdriver and not merely a bloody big vodka; hence the
  'screw'), a float of Galliano (which is in a Harvey Wallbanger; hence the
  'up against the wall'), served in a long glass (hence... oh, work it out
  for yourself).

+ [p. 74] "'GONNE'"

  'Gonne' is actually an existing older spelling for 'gun' that can be
  found in e.g. the works of Chaucer.

- [p. 113/85] "[...] or a hubland bear across the snow [...]"

  Scattered across the Discworld canon are numerous little changes in
  terminology to reflect the Discworld's unusual setup, and this is one of
  the more elegant ones, since there obviously can't be polar bears on the
  Disc...

- [p. 115/86] The Duke of Eorle.

  Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl. Of doo-wop fame.

- [p. 115/87] "One of the thoughts jostling for space was that there was no
  such thing as a humble opinion."

  Terry has admitted that the Duke of Eorl's conversational style was a bit
  of a dig at the way discussions on the net are typically held. People
  posting to Usenet newsgroups will often prefix even the most dogmatic
  monologues or megalomaniacal statements with the words "In my humble
  opinion...", in a (usually futile) attempt to render themselves
  invulnerable to criticism. The qualifier is used so often on the net that
  it even has its own acronym: 'IMHO', so you won't have to type so much
  when you use it.

- [p. 116/88] "[...] that bastard Chrysoprase, [...]"

  Webster's defines chrysoprase as an applegreen variety of chalcedony,
  used as gem, but literally from the Greek words 'chrusos', gold and
  'prason', leek. Chalcedony is a semi-precious blue-gray variety of
  quartz, composed of very small crystals packed together with a fibrous,
  waxy appearance.

  Note how both the 'gold' etymology and the 'waxy appearance' perfectly
  match Chrysoprase's character as the rich, suave, uptown Mafia-troll.

  Chrysoprase already appears (off-stage) on p. 179/178 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_",
  but his name is spelled 'Crystophrase' there.

- [p. 127/96] "'What can you make it?' Carrot frowned. 'I could make a
  hat,' he said, 'or a boat. Or [...]'"

  This may be far-fetched, but *exactly* the same joke appears in the 1980
  movie **Airplane!** (renamed **Flying High** in some countries).

- [p. 130/98] "[...] a toadstool called Phallus impudicus, [...]"

  This mushroom actually exists. The Latin name translates quite literally
  to "Shameless penis". In English its common name is "Stinkhorn fungus",
  and it has been described to me as a large, phallus-shaped, pallid,
  woodland fungus smelling very strongly of rotten meat, and usually
  covered with flies. "Once experienced, never forgotten", as my source
  puts it.

  Another mushroom expert subsequently mailed me a long, detailed
  description of the toadstool's appearance, which I'm not going to include
  here. Suffice it to say that it's full of phrases like "yellow, glutinous
  goo", "the head exudes a black slime" and "I've smelled these from 50
  paces on a still day".

  And no, the **Phallus Impudicus** is not edible.

- [p. 135/102] "A lot of equipment had been moved away, however, to make
  room for a billiard table. [...] 'My word. Perhaps we're adding just the
  right amount of camphor to the nitro-cellulose after all –'"

  In reality, nitro-cellulose (also known as guncotton) is an extremely
  explosive substance that was discovered by people trying to make
  artificial ivory for billiard balls. Camphor is nicely flammable in its
  own right.

- [p. 136/103] "'Oh well. Back to the crucible."

  As well as being alchemist-speak for 'back to the drawing board' (a
  crucible is a container used in high-temperature melting), there is also
  the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield where the World Snooker Championships
  are played.

- [p. 137/104] "'Haven't you seen his portrait of the Mona Ogg. [...] The
  teeth followed you around the room. Amazing.'"

  It can easily be observed that the Mona Lisa's *eyes* follow one around
  the room; Leonardo da Vinci supposedly achieved this by using some
  mysterious painting technique that only the greatest of painters are
  capable of. But as Tom Burnham explains in his **Dictionary of
  Misinformation**: "The eyes-that-follow-you trick is a simple one, used by
  innumerable artists in everything from posters to billboards."

- [p. 143/108] "'Brother Grineldi did the old heel-and-toe trick [...]'"

  Joseph (Joey) Grimaldi was a famous English clown and pantomime of the
  19th century. He was so influential and instrumental in creating the
  modern concept of the clown that circus clowns are still called "Joeys"
  after him.

- [p. 150/113] "Possibly, if you fought your way through the mysterious old
  coats hanging in it, you'd break through into a magical fairyland full of
  talking animals and goblins, but it'd probably not be worth it."

  Reference to the children's classic **The Lion, The Witch and the
  Wardrobe** by C. S. Lewis. See also the annotation for p. 22/22 of
  "Sourcery_".

- [p. 153/116] "I'm on the path, he thought. I don't have to know where it
  leads. I just have to follow."

  This is almost a direct quote from a scene in **Twin Peaks**:

      Cooper: "God help me, I don't know where to start."

      Hawk: "You're on the path. You don't need to know where it leads.
            Just follow."

- [p. 155/117] Zorgo the Retrophrenologist.

  For a while I thought we had finally found a troll whose name wasn't
  mineral-related, but no: zorgite is a metallic copper-lead selenide,
  found at Zorge, in the German Harz Mountains.

- [p. 157/119] "'It's Oggham,' said Carrot."

  See the annotation for p. 305/219 of "`Lords and Ladies`_".

- [p. 157/119] "Soss, egg, beans and rat 12p. Soss, rat and fried slice
  10p. [...]"

  People keep seeing a Monty Python reference in this, because they are
  reminded of the "Eggs, bacon, beans and spam..." sketch.

  But Terry says: "It's not really Python. Until recently transport cafes
  always had menus like that, except that 'Chips' was the recurrent theme.
  I used to go to one where you could order: Doublegg n Chips n Fried
  Slice, Doublegg n Doublechips n Doublebeans n Soss...

  ..and so on...

  The key thing was that you couldn't avoid the chips. I think if anyone'd
  ever ordered a meal without chips they'd have been thrown out.

  Note for UK types: this place was the White Horse Cafe at Cherhill on the
  A4. Probably just a memory. It wasn't far from where some famous rock
  star lunched himself in his car, although, come to think of it, not on
  chips."

- [p. 159/120] Some people on a.f.p. indicated that they had difficulty
  understanding just what the Gargoyle was saying, so here is a translation
  into English of his side of the dialogue:

      "Right you are."
      "Cornice overlooking broadway."
      "No."
      "Ah. You for Mister Carrot?"
      "Oh, yes. Everyone knows Carrot."
      "He comes up here sometimes and talks to us."
      "No. He put his foot on my head. And let off a firework. I saw him
      run away along Holofernes Street."
      "He had a stick. A firework stick."
      "Firework. You know? Bang! Sparks! Rockets! Bang!"
      "Yes. That's what I said."
      "No, idiot! A stick, you point, it goes BANG!"

- [p. 159/120] "[...] the strangest, and possibly saddest, species on
  Discworld is the hermit elephant."

  Our real world's hermit crab (which can be found on islands like Bermuda)
  behaves similarly: it has no protective shell of its own, so it utilises
  the shells of dead land snails. The reason why the hermit crab is one of
  the sadder species in our world as well is given in Stephen Jay Gould's
  essay 'Nature's Odd Couples' (published in his collection **The Panda's
  Thumb**): the shells that form the crabs' natural habitat are from a
  species of snail that has been extinct since the 19th century. The hermit
  crabs on Bermuda are only surviving by recycling old fossil shells, of
  which there are fewer and fewer as time goes on, thus causing the hermit
  crab to become, slowly but surely, just as extinct as the snails.

- [p. 162/123] "'He also did the Quirm Memorial, the Hanging Gardens of
  Ankh, and the Colossus of Morpork.'"

  The last two items are equivalents of two of our world's 'seven wonders
  of antiquity': the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Colossus of Rhodes.
  The Quirm memorial is less obvious. Perhaps Mausoleus' Tomb?

  There is also a similarity between the Colossus of Morpork and the
  sequence in Rob Reiner's 1985 movie **This Is Spinal Tap** where a
  Stonehenge menhir, supposedly 30 feet high, is constructed to be 30
  inches high, and ends up being trodden on by a dwarf.

- [p. 163/124] "[...] the kind of song where people dance in the street and
  give the singer apples and join in and a dozen lowly match girls suddenly
  show amazing choreographical ability [...]"

  Terry is probably just referring to a generic stage musical stereotype
  here, but the production number mentioned most frequently by my
  correspondents as fitting the context is 'Who Will Buy?' from **Oliver!**,
  a musical version of Charles Dickens' **Oliver Twist**.

- [p. 168/127] "'Some in rags, and some in tags, and one in a velvet
  gown... it's in your Charter, isn't it?'"

  This comes from the nursery rhyme **Hark! Hark!**. The Mother Goose version
  goes:

    |   Hark! Hark! The dogs do bark,
    |   The beggars are coming to town;
    |   Some in rags, some in tags,
    |   And some in velvet gown.

  **Opies' Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes** gives the last two lines as:

    |   Some in rags, some in jags,
    |   And one in a velvet gown.

  Terry's household nursery rhyme book must strike a balance between these
  two versions. The rhyme is said to be about the mob of Dutchmen that
  William of Orange brought over with him to England in 1688, with the "one
  in a velvet gown" being the Prince himself. Or else it is a reference to
  Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries, forcing monks to beg on the
  streets for a living. Take your pick.

- [p. 171/130] "'A sixteen, an eight, a four, a one!'"

  This makes perfect sense: since trolls have silicon brains, naturally
  they'd think in binary. Every number, no matter how large can be
  represented in binary (29, for instance, is 11101; sixteen plus eight
  plus four plus one). Cuddy is therefore absolutely right when he points
  out to Detritus: "If you can count to two, you can count to anything!"

- [p. 172/131] "'That,' said Vimes, 'was a bloody awful cup of coffee,
  Sham.' [...] 'And a doughnut'."

  This entire scene is a loose parody of David Lynch's cult TV series **Twin
  Peaks**, where the protagonists are forever eating doughnuts and drinking
  "damn fine coffee".

- [p. 173/131] "'And give me some more coffee. Black as midnight on a
  moonless night."

  In one of the early **Twin Peaks** episodes, Agent Cooper praises the
  coffee at the Great Northern Hotel, and is very precise in ordering
  breakfast, specifying the way the bacon etc. should be cooked and asking
  for a cup of coffee which is "Black as moonlight on a moonless night".
  Although the waitress at the Hotel is considerably less inclined to
  nitpick than Sham Harga, she also makes a comment along the lines of
  "That's a pretty tough order".

- [p. 175/133] "'[...] clown Boffo, the *corpus derelicti*, [...]'"

  "Corpus delicti" is a Latin phrase meaning the victim's body in a murder
  case.

- [p. 176/133] "The whole nose business looked like a conundrum wrapped up
  in an enigma [...]"

  Paraphrase of a famous quote by Winston Churchill, referring to Russia:
  "It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma; but perhaps there
  is a key."

+ [p. 179/135] "'He went into Grope Alley!'"

  Terry has confirmed that Grope Alley is based on Threadneedle Street in
  the City of London, which used to be the haunt of prostitutes and hence
  rejoiced in the name 'Gropecunte Lane' – its modern name is just a more
  euphemistic way of putting things. It's the site of the Bank of England.
  Some would consider this to be appropriate.

  There's also a Grope Alley in Shrewsbury, getting its name from the Tudor
  buildings on either side almost meeting each other at roof level, causing
  one to have to grope along.

- [p. 184/139] "'The word 'polite' comes from 'polis', too. It used to mean
  proper behaviour from someone living *in* a city.'"

  As far as I can tell this is utter and total balderdash. 'Policeman'
  indeed comes from 'polis', but 'polite' comes from the Latin 'polire', to
  polish.

- [p. 185/140] "Vimes had believed all his life that the Watch were called
  coppers because they carried copper badges, but no, said Carrot, it comes
  from the old word *cappere*, to capture."

  This, however, appears to be true, according to Brewer's, who says that
  it is "more likely" that 'copper' derives from 'cop' (instead of the
  other way around!), as in the verb 'to cop something', which indeed comes
  from the Latin 'capere', to take.

- [p. 189/143] "He pushed his hot food barrow through streets broad and
  narrow, crying: 'Sausages! Hot Sausages! Inna bun!'"

  From the folk song 'Molly Malone':

    |   In Dublin's fair city
    |   Where the maids are so pretty
    |   I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
    |   She wheels her wheel-barrow
    |   Through streets broad and narrow
    |   Crying 'cockles and mussels alive alive-o'

  I am told that the statue that was put up in Dublin in honour of Molly
  was such an artistic failure, that it is now fondly known by the
  Dubliners as "The Tart with the Cart".

- [p. 192/145] "'I call it a flapping-wing-flying-device, [...] It works by
  gutta-percha strips twisted tightly together.'"

  This time, Leonard has invented the rubber-band-powered model aeroplane.

- [p. 193/146] "[...] wondering how the hell he came up with the idea of
  pre-sliced bread in the first place."

  From the saying (of inventions): "the greatest thing since sliced bread".

- [p. 194/146] "'My cartoons,' said Leonard. 'This is a good one of
  the little boy with his kite stuck in a tree,' said Lord Vetinari."

  The reference to Charlie Brown's struggle against the kite-eating tree in
  Charles M. Shultz's comic strip **Peanuts** will be obvious to most
  readers, but perhaps not everyone will realise that in Leonardo da
  Vinci's time a cartoon was also a full-size sketch used to plan a
  painting.

- [p. 197/149] "'They do things like open the Three Jolly Luck Take-away
  Fish Bar on the site of the old temple in Dagon Street on the night of
  the Winter solstice when it also happens to be a full moon.'"

  I'm rather proud of figuring this one out, because I really hadn't a clue
  as to *why* this Fish Bar would be such a bad idea. Then it occurred to
  me to look up the word 'Dagon'. Webster's doesn't have it, but luckily
  Brewer saves the day, as usual: 'Dagon' is the Hebrew name for the god
  Atergata of the Philistines; half woman and half fish.

  It was actually a Dagon temple that the biblical Samson managed to push
  down in his final effort to annoy the Philistenes (Judges 16:23, "Then
  the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great
  sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god
  hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.")

  After including this annotation in earlier editions of the APF, there
  have been numerous emails from people pointing out that H. P. Lovecraft
  also uses the entity Father Dagon as the leader of the Deep Ones in some
  of his horror stories. Terry has confirmed, however, that the inspiration
  for his Dagon goes back to the original source, not Lovecraft's
  incarnation.

- [p. 203/153] "[...] Dibbler, achieving with his cart the kind of getaway
  customarily associated with vehicles that have fluffy dice on the
  windscreen [...]"

  Take an old, battered car of the type that the Waynes and Kevins of our
  world (boyfriends to Sharon and Tracey – see the annotation for p.
  106/95 of "`Reaper Man`_") often drive – a Ford Cortina or Capri is the
  usual candidate in the UK. Respray it metallic purple. Some go-faster
  stripes, possibly a la 'Starsky and Hutch' may be appropriate at this
  time. Plaster rear window with car stickers in dubious taste: "Passion
  wagon – don't laugh it could be your daughter inside", "My other car is
  a Porsche", or even: "I <heart> Ankh-Morpork". Advanced students might
  like to experiment with a stick-on cuddly Garfield in the rear window.
  Put in stretch seat-covers, preferably in luminous pink fur. Add a
  Sun-strip, possibly with the names of the owner and 'His bird' on them
  (so they can remember where to sit presumably). Hang a pair of fluffy
  dice from the rear-view mirror. *That* kind of vehicle.

- [p. 205/155] "'Chrysoprase, he not give a coprolith about that stuff.'"

  Coprolith = a fossilised turd.

- [p. 209/158] "'He say, you bad people, make me angry, you stop toot
  sweet.'"

  "Toute suite" = immediately. One of the few bits of French that the
  typical Brit is said to remember from schooldays.

- [p. 210/158] "'C. M. O. T. Dibbler's Genuine Authentic Soggy Mountain
  Dew,' she read."

  Terry is not referring to Mountain Dew, the American soft drink, but is
  using the term in its original meaning, as a colloquialism for whisky –
  particularly, the homemade 'moonshine' variety.

- [p. 218/165] VIA CLOACA

  The major sewer in ancient Rome, running down into the Tiber, was called
  the Cloaca Maxima. Anything with 'Via' in its name would have been a
  street or road. The Cloaca Maxima was actually a tunnel.

- [p. 235/178] "[...] huge scrubbing brushes, three kinds of soap, a
  loofah."

  Loofah is a genus of tropical climbing plant bearing a fruit, the fibrous
  skeleton of which is used for scrubbing backs in the bath.

- [p. 238/180] "'Hi-ho – '– hi-ho –' 'Oook oook oook oook ook –'"

  The dwarvish hiho-song. See the annotation for p. 88/73 of "`Moving
  Pictures`_".

- [p. 239/181] "'He said "Do Deformed Rabbit, it's my favourite",' Carrot
  translated."

  Running gag. See also the annotation for p. 226/162 of "`Small Gods`_".

- [p. 251/190] "'All right, no one panic, just stop what you're doing, stop
  what you're doing, please. I'm Corporal Nobbs, Ankh-Morpork City Ordnance
  Inspection City Audit – [...] Bureau ... Special ... Audit ...
  Inspection.'"

  Nobby is imitating Eddie Murphy. Terry explains:

  "Almost a trademark of the basic Murphy character in a tight spot is to
  whip out any badge or piece of paper that looks vaguely official and
  simply gabble official-sounding jargon, which sounds as if he's making it
  up as he goes along but nevertheless browbeats people into doing what he
  wants. As in:

  'I'm special agent Axel Foley of the Special ... Division ... Secret ...
  Anti-Drugs ... Secret ... Undercover ... Taskforce, that's who I am, and
  I want to know right now who's in charge here, right now!'

  Cpl Nobbs uses this technique to get into the Armoury in M@A."

- [p. 252/191] "'Have you got one of those Hershebian twelve-shot bows with
  the gravity feed?' he snapped. 'Eh? What you see is what we got,
  mister.'"

  This is straight from **The Terminator**. Arnold says to the gun shop
  owner: "Have you got a phase plasma rifle in the 40 watt range?" and the
  shopkeeper responds: "Hey, just what you see, pal".

- [p. 255/193] "'Oh, wow! A Klatchian fire engine! This is more *my*
  meteor!'"

  Perhaps obvious, but this *really* had me puzzled until I realised that
  'meteor' refers back to Sgt Colon's use of the French word 'metier' a few
  pages back...

- [p. 257/195] "'No sir! Taking Flint and Morraine, sir!'"

  These two trolls first appeared as actors in "`Moving Pictures`_".

  As far as their names go, Flint is obvious, but I had to look up
  Morraine: Webster spells it with one 'r', and defines it as "the debris
  of rocks, gravel, etc. left by a melting glacier".

  An email correspondent subsequently pointed out to me that Webster's
  definition is lacking, because (a) the spelling with two r's *is* valid,
  and (b) morraine is *unstratified* debris only. If it were stratified it
  would be called esker or kame, which are of course fluvioglacial products
  rather than just glacial.

  Hey, don't look at me – I'm just the messenger...

- [p. 258/196] "Sometimes it's better to light a flamethrower than curse
  the darkness."

  From the old saying: "It is better to light a candle than curse the
  darkness".

- [p. 258/196] "'Lord Vetinari won't stop at sarcasm. He might use' –
  Colon swallowed – '*irony*.'"

  This reminded many correspondents of Monty Python's 'Dinsdale' sketch:

  Vercotti: I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see
  Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.

  Interviewer: What did he do?

  Vercotti: He used sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony,
  metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.

  Presenter: By a combination of violence and sarcasm the Piranha brothers,
  by February 1966, controlled London and the South East.

- [p. 263/200] "'I mean, I don't mean well-endowed with *money*.'"

  Very obvious, but still: it is the conventional stereotype that both
  under-sized males as well as black males are 'better-endowed' than white
  males. Hence the joke: 'What is fifteen inches long and white?' Answer:
  'Nothing'.

- [p. 268/203] "'Shall we be off... Joey, wasn't it? Dr Whiteface?'"

  Another Grimaldi reference. See the annotation for p. 143/108.

- [p. 269/204] "'All those little heads...'"

  Clowns' faces are trademarked and cannot be copied by any other clown
  (unlike clothes or a specific act). If you are a clown, you can send a
  photograph of your face to the Clown and Character Registry, where the
  face is then painted on a goose egg (a tradition dating back to the
  1500s) and stored.

- [p. 277/210] "'Stuffed with nourishin' marrowbone jelly, that bone,' he
  said accusingly."

  All through the 1960s and 1970s, TV commercials for Pal ("Prolongs Active
  Life") dog food used to claim that it contained "nourishing marrowbone
  jelly", and showed an oozing bone to prove it.

- [p. 279/212] "Gonnes don't kill people. People kill people."

  Slogan of the US National Rifle Association.

- [p. 284/216] "'It's Bluejohn and Bauxite, isn't it?' said Carrot."

  More troll names. For Bauxite see the annotation for p. 49/37. Bluejohn
  is another one I had to look up, and again I was saved by Brewer's,
  because Webster's doesn't have it. Blue John is "A petrifaction of blue
  fluor-spar, found in the Blue John mine of Tre Cliff, Derbyshire; and so
  called to distinguish it from the Black Jack, an ore of zinc. Called John
  from John Kirk, a miner, who first noticed it.".

  Brewer's may not have the final word on this, however. A correspondent
  tells me that Blue John is actually derived from a rock called
  'Bleu-Jaune' (blue-yellow) because of its mixed colouring. This rock was
  originally named in French either because it was first found shortly
  after the Norman invasion or because the buyers were primarily French.

- [p. 285/216] "'Remember, every lance-constable has a field-marshal's
  baton in his knapsack.'"

  "Every French soldier carries in his cartridge-pouch the baton of a
  marshal of France." Said originally by Napoleon, though of course he
  would have pronounced it as "Tout soldat francais porte dans sa giberne
  le baton de mere'chal de France."

  Note that on p. 297/226 Detritus repeats the phrase as "You got a
  field-marshal's button in your knapsack", while on p. 302/230 Cuddy
  creatively manages "You could have a field-marshal's bottom in your
  napkin".

+ [p. 287/218] "'Only two-er things come from Slice Mountain! Rocks...
  an'... an'...' he struck out wildly, 'other sortsa rocks! What kind
  *you*, Bauxite?'"

  Detritus in drill sergeant mode replays a scene from the movie **An
  Officer and a Gentleman**, in which sergeant Foley (played by Louis
  Gossett, Jr) has a conversation with a new recruit as follows:

      Sgt Foley: "You a queer?"
      Sid Worley: "Hell no sir!"
      Sgt Foley: "Where you from, boy?"
      Sid Worley: "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, sir."
      Sgt Foley: "Ah! Only two things come out of Oklahoma. Steers and queers."

- [p. 295/224] "'You just shut up, Abba Stronginthearm!'"

  One of the members of the legendary Swedish pop group Abba was Bjorn
  Ulvaeus. Obviously, by Discworld logic, if Bjorn is a typical dwarf name,
  so is Abba. Not to mention the 'Bjorn Again' pun Death makes on p. 82/62:
  Bjorn Again is the name of an Australian band with a repertoire that
  consists entirely of Abba covers.

- [p. 295/224] "'Aargh! I'm too short for this shit!'"

  A phrase originating from US forces slang during the Vietnam war, where
  the tour of duty was fixed so the 'grunts' knew exactly how long, to the
  day, until they were due back in 'the world'. A short timer was one who
  didn't have long to go and therefore didn't want to put himself at undue
  risk – hence "I'm too short for this shit".

  Another popular reference to this expression is "I'm too old for this
  shit", a catchphrase for Danny Glover's character in the **Lethal Weapon**
  series of movies.

  Terry adds:

  "'I'm too short for this shit' is a line that has appeared in at least
  two grunt movies. I had intended Cuddy to use it in the sewers..."

- [p. 305/232] "'I thought you rolled around on the floor grunting and
  growing hair and stretching,' he whimpered."

  Reference to the famous werewolf transformation scenes in the 1981 horror
  movie **An American Werewolf in London**.

- [p. 307/234] "'So we're looking for someone else. A third man.'"

  A reference to the film **The Third Man**. Terry says:

  "It may be that there is a whole generation now to whom The Third Man is
  just a man after the second man. And after all, it wasn't set in Vienna,
  Ohio, so it probably never got shown in the US :-)"

  The book contains a couple of other resonances with **The Third Man**. In
  the film, the British, French, American and Russian occupation troops in
  Vienna patrol the city in groups of four, one from each country, to keep
  an eye on each other. Carrot sends the Watch out in similar squads of a
  human, a dwarf and a troll. The final chase through the sewers under the
  city also mirrors the film.

- [p. 313/238] "'As I was a-walking along Lower Broadway, [...]'"

  Terry says: "While there are 789456000340 songs beginning "As I was
  a-walking...", and I've probably heard all of them, the one I had in mind
  was 'Ratcliffe Highway'."

  'Ratcliffe Highway' (a version which can be found on the album **Liege &
  Lief** by Fairport Convention) starts out:

    |   As I was a-walking along Ratcliffe Highway,
    |   A recruiting party came beating my way,
    |   They enlisted me and treated me till I did not know
    |   And to the Queen's barracks they forced me to go

- [p. 317/241] "'Hand off rock and on with sock!'"

  The Discworld version of an old army Sgt Major yell to get the troops up
  in the morning: "Hands off cocks, on with socks!".

- [p. 318/242] "'We're a real model army, we are'"

  The New Model Army, besides supplying the name for a Goth group, was the
  Parliamentarian army which turned the tide of the English Civil War, and
  ensured the defeat of King Charles I.

- [p. 321/244] "'Yes, sir. Their cohorts all gleaming in purple and gold,
  sir.'"

  Lord Byron, **The Destruction of Sennacherib**:

    |   The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
    |   And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold...
    |   The sheen of his spears was like stars on the sea,
    |   When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

  A cohort is not an item of clothing or armour but a division of the old
  Roman Army: the tenth part of a legion, 300 to 600 men.

- [p. 325/246] "[...] Fondel's 'Wedding March' [...]"

  Fondel = Haendel.

- [p. 325/247] "'[...] it's got the name B.S. Johnson on the keyboard
  cover!'"

  Johann Sebastian Bach's initials are 'JSB', which is 'BSJ' backwards, and
  Bach was of course also involved in organ music. But Terry has mentioned
  numerous times (not just on-line but also in "`The Discworld Companion`_")
  that he did not choose the name with this intention at all.

- [p. 332/252] "'Who would have thought you had it in you,' said Vimes,
  [...]"

  Shakespeare. See the annotation for p. 227/226 of "`Wyrd Sisters`_".

- [p. 341/258] "'Detritus! You haven't got *time* to ooze!'"

  "I ain't got time to bleed!" is a line from **Predator**, another Arnold
  Schwarzenegger action movie.

- [p. 345/262] "It was important to ensure that rumours of his death were
  greatly exaggerated."

  Paraphrase of a famous quip Mark Twain cabled to Associated Press after
  they had reported his demise.

- [p. 357/271] "'Cling, bing, a-bing, bong...'"

  The scene with Vimes' watch mirrors the movie **For a Few Dollars More**.
  All the way through this film, the bad guy has been letting a watch
  chime, telling his victims to go for their gun when the chimes stop (of
  course he always draws first and kills them). At the end of the film his
  victim is Lee van Cleef, and just as the watch chimes stop, Clint
  Eastwood enters with another watch, chiming away, to ensure Lee gets his
  chance and all is well.

  Terry says: "[...] when the play of Men At Arms was done a couple of
  months ago, [Stephen Briggs]'s people actually went to the trouble of
  getting a recording of the 'right' tune for the watch.

  It was interesting to hear the laughter spread as people recognised
  it..."

- [p. 365/277] "'They call me *Mister* Vimes,' he said."

  In the Sidney Poitier movie **In the Heat of the Night** the most famous
  line (and indeed the name of the sequel) is Poitier saying "They call me
  *Mister* Tibbs."

- [p. 371/281] "'Would he accept?' 'Is the High Priest an Offlian? Does a
  dragon explode in the woods?'"

  Is the Pope Catholic? Does a bear shit in the woods?

- [p. 373/283] "'Like a fish needs a... er... a thing that doesn't work
  underwater, sir.'"

  From the quip (attributed to feminist Gloria Steinem): "A woman without a
  man is like a fish without a bicycle." Note that the bicycle is not known
  on the Discworld to anybody but the Patrician and Leonard of Quirm. And
  they don't know what it is.
